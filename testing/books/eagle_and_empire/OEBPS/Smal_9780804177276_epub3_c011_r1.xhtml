<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">T</span>hey rode out of Yupkoyvi the next morning. At the head of his jaghuns rode Jebei Noyon, the Arrow, sitting tall and proud. Once more he wore his resplendent yellow leather armor, and beside him a Mongol standard-bearer carried his spirit banner, a pole with a long fringe of jet black horsehair hanging from a circle of steel.</p>
<p class="para-p">Between the two jaghuns rode the prisoners, lashed to the saddles of captured Roman mules. With Marcellinus were Sextus Bassus, Hanska, Mikasi, Enopay, Kanuna, Pezi, Taianita, and the Chitimachan, and behind them the two chiefs of Yupkoyvi, Cha’akmogwi and Chochokpi. Taianita had regained consciousness but was still groggy, nauseous, and sullen. The Mongols had killed the remaining rank-and-file Roman soldiers the previous nightfall after all, and so these were the last survivors of the massacre in the valley of the Great Houses, the only men and women who remained.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was sure they were living on borrowed time. They had little of use they could tell the Great Khan, nothing to barter for their lives. They would be curiosities, exhibits to show off Jebei Noyon’s cleverness, along with the nauseating sacks of ears of the dead that enumerated the magnitude of his slaughter and were now being carried on either side of a Mongol packhorse, blood seeping through the hides.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page145" title="145"/>
<p class="para-p">Behind the second jaghun came the other spoils of war: the fifty or so Roman horses that had survived the battle intact and the remainder of their mules, bearing the spears, turquoise, furs, feathers, and food of the People of the Hand.</p>
<p class="para-p">As ordered, Isleifur Bjarnason had vanished. At any moment during the ravaging of Yupkoyvi, Marcellinus had expected to see the Norseman’s bleeding body tossed out of one of the T-shaped doorways, since he probably would have fought to the death to resist capture. It did not happen. Unless his corpse already lay hidden in one of the Mongols’ piles of bodies, Bjarnason had evaporated into the air, as he had on many other occasions.</p>
<p class="para-p">As the day wore on, some of the Mongol warriors galloped ahead in pairs or in fours. They were scouts and skirmishers, moving quietly into the lands ahead, hunting for possible threats and potential victims. In midafternoon the jaghuns came upon a small native village by a river, three lodges that had each contained a family. The inhabitants now lay freshly slain with their bodies piled carelessly on the ground and flies buzzing around them. The Mongol outriders took no chances.</p>
<p class="para-p">From the desert plains of the Hand they traveled north day after day, then up into the foothills of the Great Mountains, where the air was cooler and there were many streams. Jebei Noyon was as good as his word. The prisoners were allowed no food and drank only water. Toward the end of a week’s traveling, when they were all so weak that they could barely stand once they were cut loose from the mules, the Arrow allowed them each a handful of dry corn and a strand of some tough and salty dried meat that could only be horseflesh. Taianita would not eat hers and gave it to Bassus.</p>
<p class="para-p">Remarkably, the First Decurion had not died. Jebei Noyon had assigned a warrior to ride with him and dress his wound. Bassus got food when the rest of them did not. But as Bassus strengthened, Kanuna weakened. Asleep on his mule much of the time, too weak to talk, he seemed to have lost all interest in living.</p>
<p class="para-p">As for Marcellinus, he lived in a permanent daze. Without food and sufficient water he was still short of blood and quickly grew gaunt. His muscles dwindled. His burn wound and the gashes in his leg and shoulder still leaked from time to time, but eventually dried up.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page146" title="146"/>
<p class="para-p">He felt like a husk of a man, and the rest of their company was not much better. He did not know how much longer they could survive this.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Since their captors told them nothing, it was the Firebirds that flew overhead that gave the captives notice that at last they were approaching the camp of the Mongol Khan.</p>
<p class="para-p">They were back on the high plains, traveling north with the tall crags of the Great Mountains to their left. The sun rose over the desert and set in early afternoon behind the massive peaks. It was little wonder this mighty mountain chain had been such an obstacle to the Khan. Yet somewhere still to the north of them there must be a break or at least a high pass negotiable by tens of thousands of warriors and their horses and carts, and the Mongol Khan had obviously found it.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Firebirds, three of them, were flying up and down the line of the mountains. The wind was from the east, blowing up against the crags, and the three-man Mongol flying craft rode the surges and currents in the air, accustoming themselves to the ridge lift. Their pilots were by no means Cahokian in their skills; their flying was unsteady, their turns clumsy. More than once Marcellinus held his breath in the hope that the pilots would overcorrect and crash into the rocks or stall their craft and drop out of the air to crumple in a bone-smashed mess on the dry plains. It must have happened many times while the Mongols learned their flying skills, but Marcellinus never witnessed such a disaster.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Firebirds must have relayed word to the Khan of their approach, because soon another jaghun came cantering south to meet them. For the first time Marcellinus saw joy and humanity on Mongol faces as warriors greeted one another and friends joked. Congratulations were obviously being exchanged. Men bragged of their conquests, traded news, shared fresh askutasquash and fruits, and slabs of buffalo meat for roasting over their fires that night. They brought an alcoholic beverage, too, that Pezi learned was called airag. Apparently the Mongols made it by fermenting the milk from their mares. It sounded awful and smelled worse, and drinking it made the Mongols roar with laughter and sing tunelessly for hours around their campfires.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page147" title="147"/>
<p class="para-p">There was no airag for the warriors who guarded the prisoners. Those warriors were resentful of missing the party and took out their frustration by poking the captives with their spears, especially Taianita, Hanska, and the Chitimachan. It was only the prisoners’ calculated lack of reaction—assisted by their starvation diet of the last three weeks—that made the guards desist.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“Wanageeska? Tlin-Kit.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus, who had been drowsing, came fully awake. The chief from the northwest, Tlin-Kit, stood before them. He wore a nondescript tunic and a wide-brimmed cedar bark hat in place of his armor and battle mask and was not holding his hooked club. If not for his size and distinctive tattoos, Marcellinus might not have recognized him.</p>
<p class="para-p">The chief threw down a bag, which turned out to contain greasy strands of dried meat. As their Mongol guards did not object, Marcellinus quickly passed pieces of the jerky along the line of prisoners.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Good evening, sir, and we thank you,” said Pezi, and repeated the sentiment in Algon-Quian. Tlin-Kit ignored him. He looked at Taianita, who lay curled up asleep, and then said something to the Chitimachan in his bastardized Algon-Quian.</p>
<p class="para-p">She looked surprised and answered in the same language.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Be careful,” Pezi said sotto voce.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Chitimachan did not reply. She was busy holding the chief’s gaze.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tlin-Kit said something to the Mongol guards. They looked doubtful. Tlin-kit gestured across to a few rocks across the clearing. The guards shook their heads. Tlin-kit held up his arm, and the Chitimachan nodded.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Chitimachan, what?” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">One of the Mongol guards shrugged and stood to tie a cord around Tlin-Kit’s wrist. The Chitimachan held up her arm, and they looped the other end of the cord around her wrists.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page148" title="148"/>
<p class="para-p">This did not look good. Marcellinus struggled futilely against his own bonds.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Be calm,” Pezi said. “He wants to talk only. Learn things from her.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“A likely story,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“The Mongol Khan will not be pleased if his captive is destroyed. She will be all right.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Chitimachan walked off with the chief without speaking. To Marcellinus’s surprise they indeed only went across the clearing to the rocks, where they sat and talked.</p>
<p class="para-p">An hour later Tlin-Kit brought the Chitimachan back. The Mongol guards tied her back into the group of captives.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well?” Marcellinus demanded.</p>
<p class="para-p">“He is lonely,” the Chitimachan said. She leaned forward to take some dried meat from the hide in front of them. Her face wrinkled in disgust as she chewed, but she was right. They all needed strength no matter how distasteful the only food they were offered was. Marcellinus reached out for another morsel himself and then prodded her with his foot. “Come on, Chitimachan. What did he say to you?”</p>
<p class="para-p">She sighed and stared up at the sky. “Mostly he wanted to boast to someone who will listen. The Mongols are all drunk and crazy, and he does not like their airag. He grew bored. He has not talked to a woman for many weeks.</p>
<p class="para-p">“He tells me he is a great chief of his people. He comes from very far north, on the coast of the great ocean in the west. Tlin-Kit is the name of his people, not of himself.” Her lips pursed briefly in the closest thing that the Chitimachan got to a smile. “Just as mine is. And it is pronounced more ‘Tlingit,’ the way he says it with his own mouth. There are islands offshore where he lives, and great animals in the sea that his people hunt from mighty canoes and with flying craft that they call Sea Eagles. It is these Sea Eagles that the Mongols have based their flying craft on, although he says they have changed the shape so much that they are now repellent to him. He himself, the Tlingit chief, is a mighty flier and has killed many of these great sea animals from flight, but the Mongols will not let him fly on a Firebird, for he is too important to risk.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page149" title="149"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded in resignation. Truly, Great Sun Man had been mistaken about the prevalence of flying craft across Nova Hesperia.</p>
<p class="para-p">“The Tlingit chief was among the first to befriend the Cold Men—his name for the Mongols—when first they arrived along the coast several winters ago. The Cold Men told him they came from mighty lands to the west, yet crossed the great ocean by staying close to the land in the north. The distance is not so great there, perhaps.</p>
<p class="para-p">“The chief understood their power. He allied his warriors with the Cold Men, and they helped him defeat his people’s ancient inland enemies. He says that for a hundred-hundred winters they had fought a Mourning War against the weak fools from inland, but now those tribes are destroyed, their men, women, and children all dead. And so the chief has won his Mourning War, and his people have pronounced him a god for it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Her expression was sour. Marcellinus understood that of all in the Hesperian party, the Chitimachan might have the most to say about who were the true gods and who were not.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Another strong tribe from the northwest, the Haida, tried to fight the Mongol Khan. They were defeated and now serve the Khan as slaves and dig gold for the Mongols.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Having defeated their ancient enemies, the Tlingit have now joined with the Cold Men for more plunder. The mighty chief enjoyed helping the Cold Men enslave the soft, babyish tribes to the south of his homeland. He likes war. He likes killing. The Cold Men make him even stronger.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Chitimachan stopped talking and regarded them. Kanuna was shaking his head slowly; Enopay was doing the same, apparently unaware that he was unconsciously aping his grandfather.</p>
<p class="para-p">“How many of the Tlingit have joined with the Cold Men?” Marcellinus asked.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Chitimachan’s tone took on a tinge of irony. “Mighty warriors without number, of whom he is the mightiest.” She shrugged. “More than ten hundred, I think. Less than a hundred hundred.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus rubbed his eyes. The peoples of Nova Hesperia were aligning themselves with the invading outlanders, either with Roma or with its mortal enemy.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page150" title="150"/>
<p class="para-p">The Chitimachan bit into another piece of dried meat, chewed, swallowed. “One more thing. The Cold Men you see? This is only one-third of them. The Mongol Khan has two other armies. One is farther north at the Braided River, preparing for war, and it is led by the Khan’s son. The other is split into two parts. One part guards the ships and slaves on the western shore of the land; the other part is to the south of us here and headed toward the dawn.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Eastward?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes.” The Chitimachan’s eyes were bleak. “They go to strike the Market of the Mud, my home, and do battle with the Romans of the south. He told me this with great gloating and satisfaction, the Tlingit did, because he wanted to look into my eyes and drink my pain as I suffered. I mocked him and did not give him the pleasure, and I think he liked that, too: my contempt and my strength. But I suffer now.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m sorry,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">She looked puzzled. Marcellinus clarified. “Sorry that savage men from faraway lands have come into your land to kill and destroy.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It is only now that you are sorry, Roman? Now that you are at their mercy?” She shook her head.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus fell silent. He had other questions, but the Chitimachan’s face had closed against him, and he felt that he must ask no more.</p>
<p class="para-p">She sat stiff and upright. Her face was a wall. Whatever suffering the Chitimachan was feeling was buried deep within her, yet somehow Marcellinus felt that inside she was screaming.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Further indignities awaited. The next morning the prisoners were kicked awake by their captors, and pilloried.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was first. As he knelt in the dust, his hands tied behind his back, Jebei Noyon himself strode over, carrying a thick wooden board four feet across with a hole in the center and a rough iron hinge. Opening it, he slipped it around Marcellinus’s neck, locked it closed, and released it.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page151" title="151"/>
<p class="para-p">Helpless under its weight, Marcellinus tumbled forward. The board’s edge hit the ground, wrenching his neck, and with his hands tied behind him there was nothing he could do about it. The pillory must have weighed fifteen pounds. Tears sprung to his eyes, water he did not even know was left in his body.</p>
<p class="para-p">Jebei Noyon nodded, stood, and gestured: <em class="char-i">Up</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus tried. The effort of rising to his feet with the pressure of that thing on his neck, and without his hands to help, was beyond him. Gritting his teeth, he tried again and then blinked up at Jebei Noyon. “I can’t.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Tayichiud general turned away and signaled. His men brought forward other identical mobile pillories, one each for Bassus, Hanska, Mikasi, Pezi, Cha’akmogwi, and Chochokpi, and fastened them on.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was completely powerless. He was immobilized, forced to hold his body up to reduce the pain in his neck, unable to move except in a way that would cause him even greater suffering. Even if his hands were free, he would not be able to feed himself or give himself water for as long as he was locked in this thing.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay, Taianita, and the Chitimachan were spared from the pillories but not from the hobbles. Those came next, the same hobbles that the Mongols used to prevent their horses from straying too far at night. Once hobbled, the captives were roped together at the waist to form a line. Then the Mongols came and cut the bonds around their wrists.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now able to support the weight of the board with his hands, Marcellinus rocked himself upright and stood. He could not see his body or the ground beneath him. The others stood, too, and as best they were able, they began to walk. The hobbles allowed them just a few inches’ freedom of movement. It was enough to shuffle forward well enough, but Marcellinus could already tell that today’s march would be slow, painful, and humiliating.</p>
<p class="para-p">Yet he saw no mockery or sadistic joy in the eyes of Jebei Noyon or the other Mongols and Jin who surrounded them, merely satisfaction in a job well done.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols sent them out ahead on the trail. They pointed, and one of them gestured <em class="char-i">Walk</em>, and the prisoners began to get the measure of their restraints.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page152" title="152"/>
<p class="para-p">The Tlingit chief from the northwest walked up to them just before they left the camp and said something to Pezi in quick Algon-Quian, then strode off again without waiting to see if he was understood. “Bastard,” Pezi said in Latin.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, Pezi? What?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It was a warning. We must walk fast and not stop. If we sit or lie down, they will shoot arrows into us.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Merda,” Taianita muttered.</p>
<p class="para-p">They walked out of the Mongol night camp as best they could, in a straight line into the desert. Marcellinus was in the lead position of the group. Pezi was behind him, then came Hanska, with the others strung out behind her. Bassus, the most injured and least able to make a walk like this, brought up the rear, with Taianita just in front of him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus heard whimpering. He would rather not know who it was. He half turned, which was the best he could do, and peered back. Despite the Tlingit chieftain’s warning, nobody appeared to be aiming a bow at them. “Listen up, everyone, just for a moment. This will be hell, but Jove only knows what they’ll do to us if we don’t keep going. Everyone keep a tight hold of the rope in front of you, and behind as well, if you can. If someone stumbles, try to hold them so they don’t fall too heavily. Pezi, watch the ground in front of me and warn me if I’m about to trip or step in a hole or tread on a rattling snake. Everyone else, do the same for the person in front of you. Look ahead, warn them of obstacles or dangers. Bassus, shout out if you need to pause, and we’ll do our best. Taianita, watch Bassus; tell me immediately if he looks woozy.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Don’t worry about me,” Bassus muttered. “I won’t slow you down.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded, bumping his chin on rough wood. “I’ll try to keep the pace steady. All right? On.”</p>
<p class="para-p">They went on. Many of them stumbled, Marcellinus most of all, but amazingly, nobody fell. Minutes stretched into hours. The pain in Marcellinus’s neck and calf muscles became almost unbearable, but he had little choice but to keep moving.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page153" title="153"/>
<p class="para-p">He touched his tongue to his parched lips. He could not help thinking that if the Mongols left them out here like this, they would die of thirst within the day.</p>
<p class="para-p">That gruesome thought, he kept to himself.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The first of the Mongol jaghuns overtook them at noon, bearing down on them at an alarming canter. Most of the warriors rode past, including Jebei Noyon and the Tlingit. Twenty warriors, two arbans’ worth, stopped and dismounted with bad grace to give the captives water and a little food. Marcellinus and the others were allowed to sit and rest for two hours while the Mongols’ horses grazed.</p>
<p class="para-p">Exhausted, they spoke little. Marcellinus could feel blood trickling down his chest and saw that every neck was chafed and bleeding among those wearing the heavy pillories. No one wasted any breath complaining.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then the second jaghun trotted up, and Marcellinus and his small group of unfortunates were helped to their feet to continue their terrible walk.</p>
<p class="para-p">In the afternoon Bassus fell five times, pulling Taianita and Mikasi down with him. Each time Marcellinus stopped the group until one of the implacable Mongol warriors arrived to gesture them to rise again. Taianita helped Bassus as best she could, ducking under the board around his neck to put her arm around his waist and support him, and they all walked on as slowly as they dared.</p>
<p class="para-p">Fortunately, they did not have much farther to go. Escorted by the final jaghun, the prisoners arrived at the Khan’s camp around midafternoon.</p>
<p class="para-p">After the rigors, indignities, and starvation of the journey north, Marcellinus was almost relieved.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The camp of the Mongol Khan was amazingly colorful. This was no makeshift overnight halt like the camps of Jebei Noyon’s scouting party. This was a small town.</p>
<p class="para-p">The camp was circular and composed largely of a haphazard array of thousands of the one-man goatskin tents the Mongols had used on the trail. However, distributed among them was a series of surprisingly substantial structures twenty feet across and circular with a conical roof, midway between tents and buildings. Some were plain and utilitarian, covered in felt and skins or rough brown linen, but toward the center there were several much larger versions.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page154" title="154"/>
<p class="para-p">From behind them Bassus grunted, speaking for the first time in hours. “Yurts. They’re all over the Asian steppes.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“They have Hesperian slaves,” Pezi said flatly, and so they did: men and women wearing the tattoos and tunics of the land who moved around on their knees or hobbled, cooking, carrying, and doing the other work of the camp while the Mongol warriors talked and drank and sharpened their sabers.</p>
<p class="para-p">As the line of Cahokian, Roman, and Yupkoyvi prisoners shuffled into the camp, few gave them any more than a cursory glance. Just another bunch of captives at the mercy of the Horde.</p>
<p class="para-p">Farther into the camp the yurts were decorated in yellow, red, and green, boldly repeating patterns in diamond and lozenge shapes. Nor were the camp’s inhabitants restricted in their clothing to the mostly functional browns and other drab colors of their war armor; many wore shirts and trousers in bright colors and patterns. Among them walked men and women—apparently the only women here who were not slaves—wearing robes of a startling light blue who, from their stately demeanor and the variety of amulets and other decorations on their clothing, Marcellinus took to be shamans. Everywhere he heard rough laughter, saw eating and drinking and merriment, saw discipline put aside at the end of a long day’s work. All in all, the camp had a carnival atmosphere quite at odds with the grim nature of the Khan’s ruthless subjugation of western Nova Hesperia.</p>
<p class="para-p">Even amid the desperation of their predicament and the harshness of the journey, Marcellinus hit a new low point. Hesperia did not deserve this. It deserved neither the Imperator Hadrianus and his steel legions storming in from across the Mare Atlanticus to trample villages and smash down cities, murdering its men and using its women, nor the Mongol Khan and his mounted Horde assaulting the land from the opposite ocean to murder, destroy, despoil, enslave. What was happening on the Hesperian continent was a tragedy of the highest order.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page155" title="155"/>
<p class="para-p">If Marcellinus had had his freedom, he would right now have willingly renewed his pledge to do all in his power to help the bands, tribes, and nations of Hesperia against these giant, befouling monstrosities. He would have vowed it until his dying breath.</p>
<p class="para-p">Unfortunately, his dying breath might not be long in coming.</p>
<p class="para-p">They were halted, given water and a handful of corn each, and made to wait. When Pezi tried to ask questions, he was quieted, and Marcellinus’s gestured requests that they be allowed to sit received frowns and curt refusals.</p>
<p class="para-p">On a signal that Marcellinus didn’t see they were moved on again, ushered into the nucleus of the camp. Here sat the largest and gaudiest of the yurts, with a wooden platform in front of it resting on a pile of carpets. Arranged symmetrically around the central yurt were four others covered in black cloth, with tents around them. Sitting or walking in this area were hundreds of warriors in predominantly black shirts and breeches. Even the horses that stood nearby and futilely attempted to graze on the stripped ground were black.</p>
<p class="para-p">These men were strong, clear-eyed, and serious. None drank airag. None looked like men who enjoyed a tale around the campfire. Their slaves were all subdued, all kneeling, tethered by ropes to stakes driven deep into the ground. The Mongols who escorted Marcellinus and the others kept their backs straight and their eyes downcast, on their best submissive behavior. The warriors in black were the Khan’s personal Keshik guard, and even the regular Mongol warriors were daunted by them.</p>
<p class="para-p">The small procession of prisoners was halted. Once again, Marcellinus realized, he was going to be hauled into the presence of a great leader as a captive, with no chance to prepare himself and little hope of survival. He shook his head, dizzy again.</p>
<p class="para-p">And at that moment, with no fanfare or warning at all, Chinggis Khan stepped out of his yurt and walked into the mass of his personal guard, ignoring Marcellinus and the other prisoners completely.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page156" title="156"/>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol Khan, the terror of the eastern and now the western world, wore a simple blue robe with golden trim, a leather belt studded with silver, and heavy leather boots decorated with embroidered patterns in silver and gold. He was heavyset, broad-shouldered, and muscular. As with all Mongol warriors, the top of his head was shaved, but he wore small pigtails at the back of his head and over his brow. His hair was graying and his face was lined, but to a much lesser extent than many other men Marcellinus knew of sixty or more winters. He stood solid and firm, with not a hint of weakness.</p>
<p class="para-p">He reappeared from greeting his guards, smiled as he spoke to Jebei Noyon, nodded with respect to the Tlingit chieftain. Even without being able to understand the Khan’s words, Marcellinus unwillingly recognized a charisma in Chinggis that was lacking in the Imperator Hadrianus. It was, in fact, a higher degree of charisma than Marcellinus had seen in any other leader, be he Rus prince, Arabian sultan, or previous Roman Imperator. Chinggis Khan was a man who led a large and vicious army, who was responsible for the slaughter of millions and untold suffering among the survivors of his depredations, yet there was a measure of humanity and humor in his eyes that was missing from Jebei Noyon’s.</p>
<p class="para-p">Chinggis Khan was no mere killing machine. He was a leader, used to binding men to his side and bringing them along with him by the sheer strength of his will, the clarity of his vision, the certainty of his purpose.</p>
<p class="para-p">Beside him was a man who could only be the Khan’s other general, Subodei Badahur. Subodei looked ten years younger than the Khan and wore a long beard, but his most distinctive feature was a bandage that passed diagonally across his face to cover his right eye. He appeared stolid and competent. Behind them came a third man, shorter and less muscular than the Mongols, with the more pronounced facial features of a Jin. He wore a pale red silken shirt, and unlike the Mongols he had a full head of hair to go along with his pigtails.</p>
<p class="para-p">These three men now approached Marcellinus and the other captives.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page157" title="157"/>
<p class="para-p">Chinggis Khan studied Marcellinus without speaking, taking in every detail of his face, clothing, and wounds, even down to his tattered boots. Marcellinus stared back until he was done.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan moved along to Pezi. He gave each of the other prisoners the same searching study, and then he spoke. His voice was higher-toned than Marcellinus had instinctively expected. Thanks to Great Sun Man, Avenaka, Son of the Sun, and then the Imperator, Marcellinus had grown accustomed to his supreme leaders having rich baritone voices. Out of the corner of his eye he noted Pezi’s lips moving, following the syllables and rhythm of the Khan’s words even though he could have understood nothing of what the man was saying.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Jin stepped forward and in flawless Latin said, “Chinggis Khan, the Gur-Khan, the Chosen-by-God, mighty ruler of the world, welcomes you to his camp. Who leads among you? Let him speak now.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus could not stop the look of surprise that crossed his face at the fluency of the Jin’s speech. He coughed; the water he had drunk just minutes ago seemed to have been immediately absorbed into his body, leaving his mouth just as dry as it had been before. Keenly aware of the probable death sentences that hung over them all, he said, “Mighty Khan, many of us lead, and others among us may have great value to you. I am Gaius Publius Marcellinus, once Praetor of the 33rd Hesperian Legion. I introduce to you Sextus Bassus, a ranking officer of the Third Parthian Legion and the leader of this expedition. I introduce to you Cha’akmogwi and Chochokpi, leaders of the Yupkoyvi, central city of the People of the Hand.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He waited while the Jin translated. The Khan spoke again, pointing to his men. “Subodei Badahur. Liu Po-Lin.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Smoothly, Po-Lin continued. “The Great Khan introduces you to the mighty general and terror of his enemies, Subodei Badahur. I myself am Liu Po-Lin; I am Jin and played some small role in the Mighty Khan’s conquest of our mutual enemy, the Song Empire. Awaiting us are the fearless general Jebei Noyon and our honored vassal, the chief of the Tlingit tribe far to the north in our new territory, whom you have already met. You will come and sit?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page158" title="158"/>
<p class="para-p">Warriors in black were removing the pillory boards from the necks of the prisoners and freeing them from the ropes and hobbles. Marcellinus rubbed the raw and cracked skin around his neck, and his hands came away bloody. A hobbled slave woman shuffled up to him with a bowl of water. Resisting the urge to snatch it from her and drain it in a series of gulps, Marcellinus rinsed the worst of the blood and grime from his face and neck. At the other end of the line of prisoners, Bassus was doing likewise. Nobody moved to free Cha’akmogwi and Chochokpi; it seemed that as rulers of none but the dead, their participation was not required.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Would you bring a companion or word slave with you, one whom you trust?” the Jin asked politely.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked down the line but, gallingly, knew he must choose the one with the most Latin, the one who was the fastest learner. “Pezi, here beside me, knows many tongues and is my leading speaker of words.”</p>
<p class="para-p">As Pezi was freed and washed, an even greater feeling of incredulity swept through Marcellinus. The youth who once had betrayed Cahokia and taunted Marcellinus in Iroqua captivity was now to be his right-hand man in a meeting with Roma’s greatest enemy. Suddenly, he found himself unable to even look at the Iroqua boy.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan and Subodei turned and walked back to the platform outside the large, lavishly decorated yurt. Marcellinus got to his feet, trying to work the knots out of his neck. Sextus Bassus limped up to them, and Pezi took his arm. “I can manage,” Bassus said curtly.</p>
<p class="para-p">The tunic and patch around Bassus’s chest wound looked dry. Better, in fact, than the gash in Marcellinus’s leg, which he could now see for the first time that day. It was encrusted with blood, the skin around it white and strained.</p>
<p class="para-p">Nothing he could do about that now. “Gentlemen, shall we proceed?” he murmured.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Lead on,” Bassus said, matching his ironical tone, and escorted by Liu Po-Lin and two Keshik warriors in black, they walked unsteadily across the gravel desert floor to take tea with the despotic and bloody conqueror of half of Asia.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page159" title="159"/>
<p class="para-sp">They sat cross-legged on rugs, the Great Khan flanked by Subodei and Liu Po-Lin on one side and Jebei Noyon and the Tlingit chieftain on the other. Marcellinus faced them with Bassus to his left and Pezi to his right.</p>
<p class="para-p">The tea was terrible, a strong black brew with a yellow, oily substance floating in it. It burned Marcellinus’s lips and tongue, but he needed the liquid and considered it tactful to show honor to his hosts. The yellow mess was a kind of butter, half rancid, and as the whole mixture smelled like damp horse, he was in little doubt about what he was drinking. Mongols favored mares and geldings for their mounts, unlike the Romans, who largely rode stallions. Clearly the mares provided nutrition as well as transport.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan waited for them to drink and wipe their mouths. Now he spoke. Liu Po-Lin translated. “ ‘Tell me, great Roman leaders, does your Imperator truly believe he can defeat me in the battle for this land?’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus smiled and tried to mimic Po-Lin’s style of speech. “Mighty Khan, Roma and the many peoples of Nova Hesperia who have allied with her will prove to be a formidable opponent to you on the fields of war. This I promise.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“ ‘I regret that Roma will fail.’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I regret that the war must take place at all.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“ ‘If Roma leaves this continent, which your Imperator has so arrogantly cursed with a Roman name, no war need occur.’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Roma does not plan to abandon this continent to your tender mercies. And the eastern nations of Nova Hesperia, too, are united against you. Roma will fight you. Hesperia will fight you. Attack the combined forces of Roma and Hesperia, great Khan, and <em class="char-i">you</em> will fail.”</p>
<p class="para-p">This last statement earned Marcellinus sharp looks from both Jebei Noyon and Subodei Badahur. Chinggis Khan merely smiled.</p>
<p class="para-p">A Keshik warrior refilled their cups with tea. Distracted earlier, Marcellinus now noted that his cup was porcelain, presumably originating from the Jin or Song Empire. He waited for the Khan to drink again and then sipped the hot brew. He needed all the strength he could get, regardless of how revolting the beverage was.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page160" title="160"/>
<p class="para-p">“ ‘We have no need of you,’ ” Liu Po-Lin said. “ ‘From my scouts and spies, I know the numbers of legionaries of Roma that face me. I know of their native allies of the Mizipi and the lakes. I know all things.’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus tried to keep his face straight, his wits about him. If the Khan truly wanted nothing from him, he would be dead already. Marcellinus was no diplomat and hardly the man who should be in this delicate position. But Sextus Bassus sat silent, his expression surly, and clearly would be no help in this conversation.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus cleared his throat. “I congratulate Chinggis Khan on his skill with military intelligence. He will therefore also be aware that the many legions that face him across the Plains are strong, determined, remorseless, and dedicated to his utter destruction.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan smiled. “ ‘Three legions only and a few extra horsemen. But tell me of your companions now.’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus saw no reason not to tell him and every reason to elevate the importance of his companions in the Khan’s eyes. “Sextus Bassus is a decurion of the Third Legion and master of our expedition. Pezi here is Iroqua and knows many languages. Kanuna is an elder of Cahokia, and Enopay is his grandson, wise beyond his years. Hanska and Mikasi are warrior chiefs of Cahokia and also have the ear of its paramount chieftain, Tahtay. My apologies for my terseness. My throat is dry.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was running out of words, even in Latin. He wished he’d been able to sleep for the last several nights. He took another gulp of the burning salty tea and decided some embellishment might be in order. “Of the others, Taianita and the Chitimachan are great speakers of words, like Pezi, and much respected from Shappa Ta’atan to the Market of the Mud. Chack…Cha’akmogwi and Chochokpi you know to be leaders of the People of the Hand.” He had a moment of panic. Had he forgotten anyone?</p>
<p class="para-p">“As for Praetor Gaius Publius Marcellinus, he is a great general of Roma,” Pezi continued in Latin. “Victor of countless battles in Europa, he has lived in Cahokia for many winters. He is a close friend to Cahokia’s chiefs and elders and is a confidant of the Imperator of Roma. That is the total of our company.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page161" title="161"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus dipped his head, wondering if Pezi had just signed his death warrant. He felt himself begin to sweat.</p>
<p class="para-p">Liu Po-Lin finished his translation. The Great Khan nodded respectfully, sipped his tea, and appeared lost in thought.</p>
<p class="para-p">While Marcellinus waited, he noticed for the first time the bloody sacks of ears tossed carelessly on the ground at the side of the platform. His gorge rose, and he swallowed with difficulty.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol Khan looked left, out to where the other prisoners still stood, seeming to inspect them all again from afar.</p>
<p class="para-p">Finally he spoke, and Liu Po-Lin hurried to speak his chilling words. “ ‘Cha’akmogwi and Chochokpi are leaders of a destroyed race, and thus they are no leaders at all. They are useless relics of a dead culture and so will die with it.’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus struggled to breathe.</p>
<p class="para-p">“ ‘The Cahokian warriors are likewise useless to me, and they will also die.’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No,” said Marcellinus. “No, Mighty Khan, they will not.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Chinggis Khan’s eyes slowly turned to gaze upon Marcellinus. All trace of humanity had left them, replaced with a cold, almost reptilian look. Liu Po-Lin blanched. Jebei Noyon smiled faintly. The Tlingit chief and Subodei Badahur watched with interest.</p>
<p class="para-p">A Mongol sword blade appeared at Marcellinus’s throat. A Keshik warrior had arrived so silently that he had not noticed the man’s approach.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Please,” Liu Po-Lin said. “You will not disagree.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus swallowed. Panic bubbled up within him. What to do?</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan continued his judgment. “ ‘Kanuna, as an elder of Cahokia, may live to tell Cahokia of what he has seen. He will speak of my glory and of our ruthlessness, and Cahokia will tremble. The boy, Enopay…’ ” The Khan looked at Marcellinus appraisingly. Marcellinus tried to match the coldness of the man’s gaze, though he was seething inside. Chinggis continued: “ ‘The boy is less tall than a wagon wheel and is Kanuna’s kin, and so I make no war upon him. In your weakness and frailty, you will need assistance on your journey home. So for that I will allow you to keep the boy.’ ”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page162" title="162"/>
<p class="para-p">“Home?” said Bassus, the first word he had spoken. He did not have a blade at his throat.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan was again looking out across the camp. “ ‘The word slaves, Pezi, Taianita, and the Chitimachan, I will keep. They may be of use to me.’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi gave a strangled gasp.</p>
<p class="para-p">“ ‘You four shall leave my camp. Kanuna and Enopay and you, the commanders Marcellinus and Bassus. You will live with your shame, knowing yourself bested and broken in battle by the forces of the Chosen-by-God. You will report to your Imperator how you have brought about the deaths and enslavement of those you so recklessly brought to war.’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus raised his hand and pushed the naked blade away from his neck. “No, Mighty Khan. Kill my warriors? Enslave my speakers of words? No. We shall all live and leave together or we will all die together.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Now it was Bassus’s turn to give Marcellinus a look of cold consternation.</p>
<p class="para-p">Chinggis Khan smiled slightly. Po-Lin shook his head in warning and continued. “ ‘You four will take back to Roma and Cahokia the facts of Mongol strength and invincibility. Of how easily the cream of Roman cavalry was destroyed under the hoof and heel of the Mongol Khan.</p>
<p class="para-p">“ ‘You will take back the knowledge of how the People of the Hand are no more. Of how the Mongols killed the men, women, and children of Yupkoyvi, and the parrots and the goats, and even the rats and mice, and left no living thing behind.</p>
<p class="para-p">“ ‘You will take back this warning, of how Cahokia will become as Yupkoyvi, dead and without form. Cahokia and all the other cities and towns along the Mizipi, along the Oyo, among the Lakes. The peoples of the Mizipi and the Iroqua, all will be no more if they oppose me.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page163" title="163"/>
<p class="para-p">“ ‘Any nations that do not immediately bend the knee will die. I, Chinggis Khan, will own this land. Tell Hadrianus I will crush him under my boots as I crush your friends now. Tell him that the Mizipi will run red with Roman blood from Cahokia to the sea. It will be blocked, dammed with the legs and the arms and the heads of dead Romans, dead Cahokians, dead Iroqua.</p>
<p class="para-p">“ ‘My Mongol army cannot be stopped. Roma will retreat or be destroyed. Cahokia and the other nations of this land will bow to us or be annihilated. This is the message that you will carry.’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No,” said Marcellinus. “We—”</p>
<p class="para-p">A Keshik warrior seized Marcellinus’s hair from behind, pulling his head back. Sharp steel was again at his throat. Again Marcellinus tried to reach for the saber, but his arms were grabbed, his wrists forced behind his back. A few feet away Bassus roared in pain as he was similarly restrained.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">“I will not stay,”</em> Pezi said. He made no move, kept his eyes lowered in respect, but spoke firmly. “Mighty Khan, I cannot serve you. I am pledged with my life to serve Gaius Marcellinus. If I am taken from him, I will not drink and I will not eat, and I will slay myself at the first opportunity. Know this.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus would have gaped at the boy in astonishment if he’d been capable of moving his head.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Let me go, Mighty Khan. Free me and I will run to tell my people, the Iroqua, of your greatness. Of how they must kneel and lay down their weapons or perish. And the other speakers of words also: Taianita is from Shappa Ta’atan, and the Chitimachan is from the Market of the Mud. Let them go and they, too, will flee to those other cities of the Mizipi in fear and terror and similarly tell their people of your invincibility.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And the other warriors and chiefs?” Po-Lin appeared to be speaking for himself now in dark amusement. “What of them?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi raised his eyes and met the Mongol Khan’s gaze, bold and fearless, and smiled. “The Mighty Khan wants blood. Can I deny him blood, I who am worthless in his sight? Can I save everyone? No, I cannot.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page164" title="164"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus struggled, but Keshik hands still held him secure. His head was bent so far back now that he could no longer even see Chinggis Khan, could see naught but the blue sky above him.</p>
<p class="para-p">He was yanked up onto his feet. Bassus shouted out again in pain, and Pezi, too, was grabbed. The three of them were marched off the platform back to the line of prisoners, who were watching with alarm.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Keshik warriors were moving the platform off the felt rugs and rolling half a dozen of them back.</p>
<p class="para-p">The warriors came for Cha’akmogwi first. He allowed them to stand him up and walk him forward, then all of a sudden realized what was about to befall him and began to thrash in their arms.</p>
<p class="para-p">One of the Keshik warriors struck him a heavy blow to the back of the head. He went limp and groggy, and they dragged him the rest of the way and laid him down upon the carpet.</p>
<p class="para-p">They picked up Chochokpi, who was too weak to resist them. He turned his head and looked accusingly at Marcellinus.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Wanageeska?” Mikasi muttered hoarsely. “What is happening? What will they…?”</p>
<p class="para-p">From the bleak look in Marcellinus’s eyes, he guessed it. “Shit.”</p>
<p class="para-p">When they came for Mikasi, he and Hanska erupted into violent action in the same moment. Sitting calm, quiet, and unarmed they had seemed to pose little threat, but now they simultaneously leaped up and whirled.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska slammed her elbow into one Keshik’s face and grabbed the sword out of his hand. Mikasi had already felled another black-garbed warrior with his fists and was wrestling with a second for possession of his blade. At the same time he kicked out at a third Keshik, catching him in the crotch and sending him tumbling over Taianita. She kicked the warrior in the face as he passed, breaking his nose.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska stabbed Mikasi’s assailant in the gut and whirled to slash another Mongol across the throat as he ran at her. Back to back, turning, she and Mikasi fended off four Keshik warriors.</p>
<p class="para-p">One of the two men holding Marcellinus let him go and jumped forward. Marcellinus struggled and snarled, but the other man still gripped his arms in a clench of steel. He was held firmly, incapable of movement, incapable of helping Hanska and Mikasi.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page165" title="165"/>
<p class="para-p">Two Keshiks lunged simultaneously at Mikasi. He countered one, but the second blade caught him just below the ribs on the left side. The first Keshik swung again, low, carving a huge gash in Mikasi’s leg. As Mikasi crumpled forward, he snapped a single word: “Go!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska did. Breaking off from Mikasi, she knocked her assailant’s sword aside and sprinted straight for the Mongol Khan.</p>
<p class="para-p">Chinggis sat unmoving, but Jebei Noyon leaped past him, saber in hand. Two Keshiks converged on Hanska from either side; she bowled over one of them with brute force, but the other slashed at her sword arm. She roared, kicked, kept moving.</p>
<p class="para-p">Jebei Noyon was now the only man between her and the Khan, and he was unarmored, wearing only his flowing robe, but Hanska was panting now with the effort and he was fresh. Their swords met. He parried her, swung hard, pushed her back, and then the other Keshiks stormed her from behind, tripping her, kicking her to the ground.</p>
<p class="para-p">Her sword now gone, Hanska gave her bloodcurdling battle shriek and even now crawled forward toward the Khan until the Keshiks roped her ankles and dragged her away, still thrashing.</p>
<p class="para-p">Mikasi was down, blood pouring like a river from his thigh. It was a critical wound. He would bleed out in minutes. He must have known it, but he sat upright, his eyes only on Hanska.</p>
<p class="para-p">Chinggis Khan nodded and pointed to the ground.</p>
<p class="para-p">Dozens of Keshiks had come running now. Those who had failed the Khan, the six guards who had failed to stop Mikasi and Hanska, now prostrated themselves before him.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan pointed at three of them with sharp jabs of his fingers. These three men stayed down. The rest kowtowed deeply, then backed away with heads still lowered, shame and humiliation etched on their faces.</p>
<p class="para-p">Jebei Noyon handed his saber to Chinggis. The Khan stepped forward. Apparently he himself would serve as the executioner of the men who had failed him.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page166" title="166"/>
<p class="para-p">His expression still bleak and hard-edged, the Khan swung the saber in a great arc, slicing the head from the shoulders of the first doomed Keshik with a single blow.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus averted his eyes. He cared little for the fates of the Khan’s guards, but the ruthless expression on Chinggis’s face was chilling him to the bone.</p>
<p class="para-p">Beside him, Hanska looked back at Mikasi. Her face creased with deep sorrow. She held out one hand. Thirty feet away, Mikasi reached out a hand to her in return and smiled. Despite his wound he attempted to stand, but a Keshik held him down.</p>
<p class="para-p">His grisly retribution completed, the Khan spoke. The Keshiks holding the rope tugged on it and dragged Hanska back across the ground to Mikasi. He almost fell on her, and they embraced.</p>
<p class="para-p">Keshiks rolled the carpets back over the living but prostrate bodies of Cha’akmogwi and Chochokpi and set the wooden platform back over them. Theirs would be a death by suffocation.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol Khan looked once more at the scene before him, his expression serene once more. He met Marcellinus’s eye and nodded. Then he turned, mounted the platform, and walked into his yurt.</p>
<p class="para-p">All was quiet. Kanuna sat, his arms around Enopay. The others sat alone in their misery. The Mongols stood unmoving.</p>
<p class="para-p">For several agonizing minutes they waited for Mikasi to die. Finally his eyes closed. Hanska held him for a moment longer and then rolled onto her back, staring at the sky, her face bleak.</p>
<p class="para-p">On orders from Jebei Noyon, the remaining prisoners were collected, tied, and hobbled again. Hanska did not resist when they roped her back into the chain of prisoners, met nobody’s eye, and did not respond to Taianita or Bassus when they placed their hands on her arms in a futile attempt to comfort her.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was numb. He could not believe that he was still alive, that Mikasi was dead, that the two shaman-chiefs of Yupkoyvi were even now dying an agonizing death by suffocation beneath layers of choking felt.</p>
<p class="para-p">Could not believe that Hanska had fought through to within a dozen feet of laying her hands on the Mongol Khan. Or that she now stood so broken and desolate before him.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page167" title="167"/>
<p class="para-p">Jebei spoke one last order, and the Keshiks guided their prisoners forward. They shuffled away from the yurt of the Great Khan and, painfully slowly, out through the Mongol camp.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“The Khan admires valor, and your woman warrior has shown it in abundance. Was not Jebei Noyon spared after shooting an arrow into the neck of the Great Khan? Did he not then grow in the Khan’s service to become one of his mightiest generals? And so the Khan spares Hanska. You may need her strength to help you get home, for your way will be hard indeed. The Chosen-by-God gifts her back to you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska did not react, did not even blink, merely sat still and broken. Her life seemed to have no importance to her.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Pezi also spoke bravely and has bought the lives of Taianita and the Chitimachan. They, too, may leave with you.” Liu Po-Lin gave a small bow. “I have made the humble suggestion to the Khan that without the help of the women you will not survive the journey, wounded and frail as you are. But Pezi himself will stay to serve the Khan.” Liu Po-Lin smiled. “One never knows when an extra fluent speaker of Latin may be advantageous.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi stared aghast. He did not struggle, did not speak. He merely looked at the Jin and the Great Khan and then at Marcellinus, his eyes pleading. At the moment of being praised for valor, he seemed to have lost his strength altogether.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan spoke, and Liu Po-Lin now adopted the formal voice he used when he was translating directly. “ ‘And so, Gaius Publius Marcellinus and Sextus Bassus, you will travel in shame and defeat along a mighty river, escorted by women, children, and a broken old man.’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">Liu Po-Lin began to bow, but the Khan continued to speak, his eyes glinting. “Oh, but there is more,” said the Jin. “The Mongol Khan has instructed me to convey to you his next move in wresting Nova Hesperia from the Roman grasp. When first you met his general Jebei Noyon, he was returning from a mission even farther south than Yupkoyvi. In the southlands of Nova Hesperia the continent narrows to an…isthmus? Yes?…A mere one hundred and fifty li across, perhaps fifty of your Roman miles? There the great sea of the west and the gulf are separated by only two days’ march. And there we have taken the small, deadly fighting ships of the Mongol fleet. With the help of the People of the Sun, we have…portaged?…them from the sea to the gulf. On hides greased with oil, our ships can slide across the land just as they cruise the seas.” Liu Po-Lin smiled self-deprecatingly. “A minor suggestion of my own. The Khan’s general, Subodei Badahur, will make haste to join them, and under his command our fighting ships will destroy your Roman navy. Your southern legion will be crushed, and the Hesperian Market of the Mud and the southern Mizipi will fall to the Mongol Khan. He tells you this with joy, for he knows you cannot travel faster than his ships. By the time you arrive back at the Mizipi, your southern legion will be lost.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page168" title="168"/>
<p class="para-p">“The Chosen-by-God wishes you a speedy journey back to the Mizipi, Praetor Gaius Marcellinus. May you weep at what you find, and may your Imperator Hadrianus weep when he learns what has befallen both your expedition and his great legion of the Sixth Ironclads.</p>
<p class="para-p">“And so the Khan bids you farewell, Gaius Marcellinus, until we all meet again, and urges you to paddle fast. Paddle fast.”</p></div></body></html>

<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">T</span>he raft was ten feet by eight, rough logs lashed together with thongs made of hide. Barely enough space for the seven of them: Marcellinus, Hanska, Kanuna, Enopay, Bassus, Taianita, and the Chitimachan.</p>
<p class="para-p">The river was scarcely big enough to support their journey. Around two-thirds of the time it was deep enough for the raft to float, and the few able-bodied among them could pole it along. At other times they had to manhandle the raft laboriously through shallows or past meager rapids, over rocks, around low waterfalls.</p>
<p class="para-p">Day by day, Bassus was recovering. After the battle at Yupkoyvi, Marcellinus wouldn’t have bet on Bassus even surviving the night. Yet the man whose life had appeared to be bubbling out of him as a result of his sucking chest wound was soon able to do some gentle carrying and foraging, although poling the raft taxed his muscles in a way he still could not manage.</p>
<p class="para-p">Kanuna, in contrast, was wasting away. His physical wounds were not severe, but witnessing the Mongol slaughter at Yupkoyvi had clearly damaged his will to live. Despite Enopay’s and Marcellinus’s best efforts, Kanuna’s health was failing almost as they watched.</p>
<p class="para-p">As for Hanska, she spoke to nobody, said nothing. She followed instructions calmly, sat where she was told on the raft, helped carry it when ordered to, but otherwise did not respond. She did not forage, rarely paddled, and never poled. Taianita, who dressed her wounds, sometimes hugged the bereft warrior for hours on end. Hanska would tolerate this from Taianita, but if anyone else touched her, even with a light finger to the arm, she shook it off. After the first few days Marcellinus gave it up and let her grieve in her own way.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page170" title="170"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was weak and dizzy much of the time. The blistered burn wound in his side was unbearably tender to the touch and leaked unpleasant fluids. Liu Po-Lin had been right about one thing: they certainly would have died if not for Taianita and the Chitimachan helping to pole and carry the raft; foraging for roots, berries, and wild mushrooms; and snaring occasional small mammals that Marcellinus decided not to ask too many questions about.</p>
<p class="para-p">“And so we are free,” Enopay said quietly, lying on the bank and staring down into the river, his arm in the water up to his elbow.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Free.” Marcellinus looked around them at the desolate terrain. They were descending from the high plateau, but food was still desperately hard to come by. Every day was a struggle, and he had never been so aware of the murderous scale of the continent of Nova Hesperia, where even a scrawny river like this could wend its way through hundreds of miles of desolate territory. “Yes, we’re free all right.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Free to tell our peoples how the Mongol Khan will destroy them without mercy.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Now Marcellinus looked at Enopay. “Free to report that the Khan and his warriors deserve no quarter. Free to do whatever we must to rid Hesperia of them once and for all.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I think we cannot,” Enopay said. “I think we are lost. All-done. Alive for now…but dead.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No, we—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hush, now.” Enopay’s hand closed, but the fish he was seeking had slipped from his grasp. Frustrated, the boy pulled his arm from the cold river and rubbed the feeling back into it before easing it under the water’s surface once more.</p>
<p class="para-p">A small dam would work better, cutting off a portion of the river. Herd the fish into it and then capture them. They had done that two days before. Perhaps they would do it again tomorrow. Today Marcellinus didn’t have the energy. “Enopay? We will destroy the Mongols. I swear it.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page171" title="171"/>
<p class="para-p">“Ha. Will you also swear that Mikasi will come back to life? That my grandfather will live long enough to see Cahokia again?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Those questions, Marcellinus had no answer for. He tried again. “We have been freed to take the story of the Khan’s brutality home. He hopes that the account of their ruthlessness in Yupkoyvi will destroy Roman morale, just as the stories of their relentless massacres of the northern Song caused the rest of that empire to crumble. But that will not happen.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Ha.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Enopay, say ‘Ha’ one more time and I’ll push you into the river with your damned fish.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay gave up and rolled onto his back, wiping the water from his hand. The look he gave Marcellinus was bleak. “Do not misunderstand me, Eyanosa. I have not given up. I will do all I can to help Roma. I will urge and encourage and beg and plead Cahokia to stand strong. But no. At the end of the day, we cannot prevail against such evil men.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Decinius Sabinus had told Marcellinus the same thing. The mere memory of standing on the first plateau of Cahokia’s Great Mound brought a lump to his throat. He swallowed. “Enopay, this defeatism is exactly what the Mongol Khan wants. It is why we are still alive. It’s the job he has given us: to spread hopelessness and fear. If we are demoralized, his battle is already won.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You think I am defeated? No.” Enopay stood. “You think you are the only one who can swear high and mighty oaths? Here is mine. I am Enopay of Cahokia, and I will fight the Mongols until I die.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s blood chilled. “Enopay…”</p>
<p class="para-p">“My grandfather will pass away soon, and I will not have him anymore. Cahokia is changed forever. The Romans are here to fight and die beside us. I will work without rest to help the Romans until the Mongols cut out my guts or suffocate me under a carpet. I have spoken. And so you must teach me to fight.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page172" title="172"/>
<p class="para-p">“You’re joking,” Marcellinus said. “You?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, me.” The boy frowned. “You are about to say that my skills in counting and keeping track of people and things make me better suited to work behind the battle line than on it. But one day I might find myself on that line whether we like it or not.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus did not reply. Enopay persisted. “In Yupkoyvi you told me to pick up a sword. Next time I would like to know better what to do with it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And had you been more of a threat to them, the Mongols might have killed you there.” It was moot anyway. “Enopay, I don’t have the strength to teach you. I can barely pole, let alone wave a gladius.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay looked at him, pain in his eyes, then stood and stalked off without a word. Marcellinus let him go, and stayed alone with the babbling brook and his thoughts.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">When they first had been placed aboard the raft, Marcellinus had suspected a trick. Jebei Noyon himself had stood nearby on the bank, his hands behind his back and his face unreadable. Ten of the Khan’s trusted Keshik warriors had escorted them to the waterside, unlocked the wooden pillories from around their necks, and cut the hobbles that chained their ankles. On board the raft were a single long pole, an unstrung hunting bow of much more primitive design than the Mongol war bows, two dozen arrows, and two pugios, the weapons all tied to the boards of the raft with sinew so that they could not easily be snatched up and used.</p>
<p class="para-p">Many of the Keshiks carried strung Mongol composite bows with quivers of arrows slung over their shoulders. Marcellinus had half expected this to be a cruel joke and figured that they would be slaughtered for sport as soon as they reached the center of the river, but it was not so. The erstwhile captives had been allowed to pole and paddle themselves clear. Jebei Noyon, the general in yellow, strode away without looking back. The Keshiks merely stood and watched them until they passed out of sight.</p>
<p class="para-p">Soon the current had plucked the raft and swept them through a high-sided canyon. This had been one of the most dangerous moments. Still in shock, their minds slowed by grief and hunger, they had been late to react to the rocks that threatened to tear the raft apart. Marcellinus had had to shout desperate profanities at them while fending off rocks with his bare hands before Enopay and Taianita stirred themselves from their funk and helped him, the Chitimachan grabbed the pole and started ineffectually trying to steer, and Bassus, lying down, worked at the knots that held the knives and bow down. When they later passed a stand of pinyon juniper and pine, Marcellinus made them beach the raft while they cut light branches and wove them together to form crude paddles. He also gave them a stern talking to, trying to focus their minds on the ordeals ahead rather than those they had just endured. They hated him for several days afterward, but at least the voyage went a little more smoothly.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page173" title="173"/>
<p class="para-p">For the first few weeks the river continued its halting journey through narrow canyons interspersed with steppe grassland and short-grass prairie. In the distance they saw mesas and escarpments, none of which they recognized. Once a dust storm appeared around them as if by magic, filling their mouths with grit and peppering the surface of the raft as they floated on the river, lying prone. Then, all of a sudden, they were free of the canyonlands and into what seemed to be a vast expanse of prairie, with no tree or living creature in sight.</p>
<p class="para-p">None of them knew the river they were floating down. None had been there before. Enopay had glumly labeled it the Stream of Piss, and the name had caught on. Between Enopay and the Chitimachan, their best guess was that they were traveling parallel to the Kicka River they had ridden alongside into the west but two or three hundred miles south of it.</p>
<p class="para-p">Three hundred miles south of the Kicka meant they were as much as six hundred miles south of the Wemissori. They had a <em class="char-i">long</em> way to go.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“I’m sorry,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Kanuna turned his head with difficulty. The elder looked twenty winters older than he had just a few short weeks ago: limbs weary, face lined, lips cracked. “For what?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page174" title="174"/>
<p class="para-p">Taianita and the Chitimachan were poling. Enopay, on the far side of the raft, appeared to be asleep. Hanska sat staring downriver. Marcellinus handed Kanuna a water skin. “Drink. Even a little. I am sorry that I brought you on this journey and your grandson, too.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Perhaps that was a shrug. “It is the Mongols who should apologize, and they never will. You? Your valor…” Kanuna’s face creased, and he gave a weak cough that nonetheless seemed to rattle around his rib cage.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I beg of you,” said Marcellinus. “Today of all days, say nothing of valor.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Then I will say this. Take care of Enopay for me, Gaius. And…take care of Cahokia.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“To the best of my small ability,” Marcellinus said, grimacing, “I will, Kanuna. You know I will. But I wish I could do it with you by my side.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kanuna coughed again. “When I saw your warriors coming…the first time, when the 33rd Hesperian marched on Cahokia. All that steel…it was the most terrible thing I had ever seen. Yet that was nothing. Since then, I have seen so much worse. Too many terrible things, Wanageeska.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m sorry,” Marcellinus said again.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Never did I think I would outlive Great Sun Man. But now I find I am glad that he will be the first to meet me once this is over.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus stole a quick glance at Enopay, but the boy was still fast asleep.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Nor did I think that I would see the end of the Mourning War with the Iroqua. Nor that my most desperate enemy might become my closest friend.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus gently squeezed the elder’s shoulder. “You are one of the best men I have ever known, Kanuna.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Ha. But as for those Mongols…” Kanuna shook his head almost imperceptibly.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Don’t speak of them now,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Destroy them. Cleanse the land of their filth. And then send the Romans away from our city as well.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page175" title="175"/>
<p class="para-p">It seemed impossible, beyond any rational hope. Marcellinus grinned and tried to make light of it. “If those are your last requests, you old fox, you set a high bar.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Bar? Perhaps.” Kanuna twitched his head again, not smiling. “But above all, Wanageeska: Enopay.”</p>
<p class="para-p">There, Marcellinus certainly could agree. “Enopay. Yes, I will always look after Enopay. You have my word, Kanuna.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Kanuna died in his sleep that night. His body was gaunt and emaciated, but his face was strangely peaceful, as if he welcomed the release. Marcellinus awoke to find Enopay sitting by his grandfather’s side, his face solemn.</p>
<p class="para-p">“He is the lucky one,” Enopay said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m sorry, Enopay. And I’m doubly sorry that I brought you here.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What? If you had not brought me, I would not have been with him at the end.” Enopay tugged some of his grandfather’s gray hair from the back of his head—it took no more than a soft pull to free it—and tucked it into his tunic.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s eyes were dry. None of them had the luxury of tears. Even though he had plenty of water to drink these days, his tongue still kept sticking to the roof of his mouth, and it hurt to swallow.</p>
<p class="para-p">In death, Kanuna’s face looked calm and composed and somehow younger. He looked again like the man Marcellinus had met long before, had first smoked tabaco with in the sweat lodge with Great Sun Man and the others. The man Marcellinus had talked with long into the night about steel and wheelbarrows and the Big Warm House back in those long-ago days when Marcellinus had hoped he could benefit the Great City and its people, perhaps the whole of the land, with his Roman ideas. He shook his head.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay watched his grief. “You will help me bury him, Eyanosa? You, me, and Hanska if I can rouse her. Just us. Those who knew him longest, who loved him the best.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of course, Enopay.”</p>
<p class="para-p">They could not get Hanska’s help. She looked briefly aghast at being asked to join a burial party and put her hands over her eyes and sat as if carved in stone. They had to leave her and accept Taianita’s help instead.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page176" title="176"/>
<p class="para-p">They buried Kanuna in a shallow grave with a small mound covering him. A deeper burial would have been better and more appropriate, but they simply did not have the strength.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“Teach me to fight.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked up, but Enopay was not talking to him. Hanska was sitting on the riverbank, hugging her knees and staring out across the brown water. On the other side of the river in the middle distance was a Caddo encampment of two lodges with a dugout on the bank next to them. The inhabitants ignored Marcellinus’s group of survivors, showing no signs of approaching them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita and the Chitimachan were off foraging in the opposite direction. Marcellinus was sitting by Bassus, neither of them speaking. Enopay had returned from his own foraging trip with a pile of berries and wild turnips. He was directly facing Hanska, who was ignoring him.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Teach me to fight,” Enopay said again. “Hanska? I need to know how to fight. And the Wanageeska will not teach me.” He poked her with his toe.</p>
<p class="para-p">She stood and walked away to the water’s edge.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hanska?” Enopay got up and trotted after her. But when he reached out a hand to touch her arm, she shoved him away so hard that he fell.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Juno, Hanska…” Marcellinus struggled to his feet, but Enopay hand-talked <em class="char-i">Be silent</em> and stood again. “Hanska, I know why you are being like this. But I need to learn how to defend myself or perhaps I will die, too.” Enopay walked around Hanska, standing perilously between her and the water, and stared up at her. “Yes, I am small. Yes, of course I am ridiculous. I do not look like a warrior. All the more reason for me to learn how to become one.”</p>
<p class="para-p">At that, Hanska looked down at him thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hanska?”</p>
<p class="para-p">She grabbed his shoulders. “Shut <em class="char-i">up</em>, boy. Stop talking. Leave me alone.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page177" title="177"/>
<p class="para-p">She released him. Enopay swayed on the water’s edge, a hurt expression on his face. Hanska shook her head, looking neither sad nor angry, and walked away.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus sighed, summoned up all his strength, and followed her.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">She walked half a mile and then sat on a rock. Her head was still shaved at the sides in the Cahokian warrior style, but her hair was loose in mourning. It somehow made her look ferocious rather than vulnerable.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus sat down beside her. “We need your help, Hanska.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She ignored him, as usual.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hanska? I know you can hear me. It’s time to stop.” He took a deep breath, hating himself. “Or are you too weak to help us? Too feeble and broken?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Finally she stirred. “Fuck off.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Well, at least she was talking to him. “I’m sorry, Hanska.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“<em class="char-i">You’re</em> sorry?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Her fingers flexed, forming fists. Marcellinus remembered Sintikala saying that she had killed people, some of them her friends, in her grief at losing her husband.</p>
<p class="para-p">Perhaps Hanska would kill him. Nonetheless, he had to do this. “We need you. You’re our strongest warrior.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska looked around them very slowly and carefully, as if taking in her surroundings for the first time. “I see nobody here to fight. When I do, you can count on me. As you always do. For now…” She gestured in hand-talk: <em class="char-i">Go away. Fuck off.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked at her and thought of trying to say something else. She had, in fact, fought magnificently, but he could hardly talk to her of the moment when Mikasi had died.</p>
<p class="para-p">Perhaps this was hopeless. He stood. “If you need anything, Hanska, ask.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I need nothing.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus left her to her grief. But the next night when they went ashore, Hanska disappeared into a small copse for a while and returned carrying several rocks and a few stout pieces of wood. The next day on the raft they were all maddened by the repetitious sound of her knapping flint and her occasional swearing as she threw one rock overboard and began anew with another, but by the middle of the second day she had constructed a hardy ax with a wooden haft and a stone blade. By the end of the third day she had made two more and had moved on to making short thrusting spears out of ash wood and bone.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page178" title="178"/>
<p class="para-p">Next, Hanska made two practice swords out of wood and began to spar with Enopay. Hanska was showing signs of life again.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">They had lost some altitude now, having descended from the high plains several days before. Once again, the temperature was rising steadily as they headed toward high summer on the prairie. By now the river had grown sluggish and meandering, weaving back and forth across the terrain, bounded by red mudflats. The lethargy of the river was not enough to propel the raft forward; between them Marcellinus, the Chitimachan, and Taianita took it in turns to pole the boat while one or two of the others paddled. The tedium of the landscape was such that Marcellinus sometimes would look up after what seemed like hours of sliding the long wooden pole into the water and shoving it hard into the sand and mud beneath it, sometimes pushing the edge of the raft under the water in his efforts to propel it forward, only to find that the terrain around him looked almost exactly the same as when he had begun his shift.</p>
<p class="para-p">Few people lived along that river. Very occasionally they would pass a homestead. They did not ask for help, expected none, and for their part the inhabitants gazed at them until they were past. They were deep in Caddo land now. Taianita spoke the language, but the natives of the region did not look friendly, and neither she, Marcellinus, nor any of the others felt safe approaching them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Conversation was almost negligible during the day. It was only in the evening when the foraging parties went out and the others effected repairs to the raft and their clothes that any discussions took place. It was a dour, relentless journey through a largely unchanging and inhospitable countryside.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus found himself gripped by an overwhelming sense of frustration. The urgency of their quest was unmistakable: this was a ruthless race against time. Far to the south, Mongols under Subodei Badahur were advancing east to join their fleet and battle the Sixth Ferrata. Far to the north, Roma and the Hesperian League were preparing to face the twin armies of the Mongol Khan and his son Chagatai. Far to the west, on the other side of the Great Mountains, a vast territory Marcellinus had never seen was groaning under the Mongol rule of Yesulun, its people enslaved to mine gold for the invaders.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page179" title="179"/>
<p class="para-p">Up the Wemissori in Hidatsa and Blackfoot territory the Romans were on their own similar hunt for gold. Without the slavery, or at least not yet.</p>
<p class="para-p">And in the meantime, Cahokia was still oppressed by Roman occupation. What would be happening there now? Was the Imperator really keeping Agrippa in check, or had it all gone to hell? Was Sintikala safe? Kimimela?</p>
<p class="para-p">The alliance hung by a thread. Even if the Mongols could be resisted, Roma was surely still a huge threat to Cahokia and to the whole of the Hesperian League.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had spearheaded the first invasion of Nova Hesperia. Now he was hurrying to take information about its second invaders back to an allied army ranged against them.</p>
<p class="para-p">And, if possible, preserve their own lives. Because if Marcellinus and his crew ended up behind the Mongol invasion line, their stay of execution might prove to have been brief indeed.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Individual homesteads now gave way to small villages of several lodges, a few families huddled together on the riverbanks living off small cultivated garden areas, rabbits, and the occasional buffalo. The Hidatsa and Blackfoot much farther north did not eat fish, and there was little sign that the locals here did either. On the whole river trip, the only people Marcellinus saw trying to catch fish were Enopay and Bassus.</p>
<p class="para-p">The raft was floating through Caddo territory in earnest now, and Marcellinus constantly worried that its inhabitants might seek other prey. From time to time a Caddo band of six or twelve warriors might stand on the riverbank and watch the raft go by, looking at Taianita and the Chitimachan with hungry eyes. At the attention Taianita lowered her gaze, perturbed, and Marcellinus had her sit rather than draw even more attention by poling the raft. By contrast, the Chitimachan stared at the men contemptuously, perhaps chilling them with the ice of her stare. Hanska did not exactly brandish her ax, but she certainly made sure it was visible. Marcellinus and Bassus did the same with the wood bow and the blades, and everyone aboard the raft stared out confidently as if ready for anything. No reason for the people on the shore to realize these were the only weapons they owned or how weak and injured they still were.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page180" title="180"/>
<p class="para-sp">The Chitimachan stirred. “I have been here before.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked at her, uncomprehending. Taianita, poling the raft and sweating, scanned the banks and shook her head. To Marcellinus and perhaps to her, the landscape was gently rolling grassland as far as the eye could see, the kind of terrain that so numbed Marcellinus’s senses that after a while it was hard to drag a coherent thought through his brain.</p>
<p class="para-p">In the distance was a black smudge that might have been a buffalo herd. Unexpectedly, his mouth watered. Hard now to imagine that after the great buffalo hunt with the Blackfoot on the Plains he had gorged on so much meat that he had never wanted to see it again.</p>
<p class="para-p">Another desultory river had joined them from the left a little while before, almost as still and lifeless as the one they were on. None of them had remarked on it at the time. Now the Chitimachan sat up. “This is now the Kicka. Many weeks east of where we rode alongside it before, but still the Kicka. We were on a tributary of it all the time. Now we will travel on it to the Mizipi.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus groaned, and Enopay plunged his head into his hands. This meant they still had hundreds of miles to go before they met the Mizipi. And the Kicka flowed due southeast for much of its length, and so they would be moving farther away from Cahokia all that time rather than toward it. The Kicka fed into the Mizipi halfway between Cahokia and the Market of the Mud, well south of Shappa Ta’atan. From there they would have to fight the Mizipi upriver all the way or trek along its banks on foot.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page181" title="181"/>
<p class="para-p">Taianita caught his eye and shook her head, and she was right. They were all perpetually hungry and exhausted. It was not the time to discuss the length of the journey still ahead of them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Suddenly, Marcellinus realized the brighter side of this coin. “Signal stations.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What?” said the Chitimachan.</p>
<p class="para-p">“The Roman way stations on the Line of Hadrianus. Any time now, we should start coming across them.”</p>
<p class="para-p">And so they did, the very next day.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The Roman outpost was surprisingly substantial. It was a two-story structure ten feet across at the base set within a turf rampart, the whole surrounded by a V-shaped ditch six feet deep and eight feet across. The upper floor had a parapet around it. Marcellinus knew it for simple wattle and daub, sticks of willow or hazel covered in clay, but the thickness and evenness of the clay made it almost indistinguishable from stone.</p>
<p class="para-p">Suspended above the second floor was a platform of wood held aloft by four stout timber uprights. Providing access to the platform was a ladder sheathed in a column of wooden planks for protection against arrows, and on its top was a large bowl that surely contained the contubernium’s signal fire.</p>
<p class="para-p">They stared at the signal station from midriver for several minutes before going ashore. Somehow the military solidity of the structure was daunting. That, and the apparent absence of life within it.</p>
<p class="para-p">“This is what you built? These are all across the Grass?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded. In truth such a watchtower would be quick to build for trained legionaries, but it looked alien here, deep in the wilds of Hesperia. “One every twenty or thirty miles along every river and in a line north as far as the Wemissori. They may not all look quite like this.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Shit,” said Enopay, and looked at Marcellinus in admiration as if he were personally responsible for building every one of them. The Chitimachan, in contrast, was stone-faced, no doubt perceiving the watchtower as an affront to her land.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page182" title="182"/>
<p class="para-p">“Shouldn’t there be a sentry?” Enopay asked.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of course there should.” A post station was not much good without vigilant sentries. “We built these to be staffed by at least eight men on constant watch.” This one might have held twelve or sixteen. Agrippa, or his tribunes or engineers, might have been leery of trouble from the Caddo.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s hails were not answered, and however hard he stared, he wasn’t going to be able to see through the walls. “Hanska, you’re with me. The rest of you, stay on the raft. Be ready to cast off at a second’s notice.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The warrior glanced at the fortlet without interest. “Nobody’s there.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We don’t know that. What if a Caddo war party attacked the Romans and they’re still in the area?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Then why would we go in?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“To find out. Come.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He expected her to refuse or ignore him. Instead Hanska shrugged, picked up her ax and slung a second one over her shoulder, and followed him up the slope to the signal post.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">On the ground floor they found a rough table and chairs, a few bowls, and eight sleeping pallets. On the second were four more sleeping pallets and a sack of grain. Nowhere did they see any signs of a fight.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska stooped quickly to touch the floorboards and examine her fingertips. “Some grass stalks. No dust.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She did not need to say any more. There were no personal effects or cooking tins, and the place was clean. No sign of a slaughter and every indication of a recent evacuation.</p>
<p class="para-p">“They withdrew,” Marcellinus said. “Probably recalled. Which must mean that the Mongol assault on Roma has begun.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“On Roma?” Hanska swung her ax into the wall nearest her. Splinters flew.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page183" title="183"/>
<p class="para-p">He stepped back and corrected himself quickly. “On Hesperia. On all of us.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She pulled the ax out, shook her head at him, and climbed the ladder onto the platform. When Marcellinus joined her, she was poking the ashes of the signal fire with an unburned stick. “A week? Maybe more.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus scanned the horizon. The post was well sited. The sentries on watch would have seen any Mongol incursion from the west a good fifteen miles away. He could not see the next signal stations in the line to the north or the south, but the view was clear to the horizon, and any fire would have been easily visible.</p>
<p class="para-p">He looked down the line of the river, feeling bleak. Abandoned a week or more ago? If he’d believed in gods, he’d have sworn they were all against him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska prowled the top of the tower, glancing back at the raft that awaited them on the riverbank. She looked at her feet and then turned to face him. “I’m sorry, Gaius.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded. He could see her eyes, and so he did not need to ask. Hanska told him anyway. “For…leaving you for a while. Falling into my own head. Not helping. Being useless. And acting like a verpa.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No apology needed.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“For all of it.” She raised her eyes to gaze into the blue of the sky. “I let you down.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No. Never. Hanska, I’m sorry about—”</p>
<p class="para-p">She raised her hand in a sudden motion and cut him off.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus wanted to tell her that he understood. He wanted to say <em class="char-i">If I ever lost Sintikala…</em> But that was a thought too large for his mind to encompass, and perhaps Hanska already knew. He leaned on the parapet, looking out over the endless grasslands.</p>
<p class="para-p">What was happening in Cahokia? He had no idea. They had been away almost a full year. Once again he felt almost unspeakably apprehensive about what might have happened there in the meantime.</p>
<p class="para-p">Eventually, he turned.</p>
<p class="para-p">She had fallen still, staring at the ashes of the signal fire. Marcellinus stepped forward, worried that she might have relapsed back into a fugue state. “Hanska?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page184" title="184"/>
<p class="para-p">She drew herself up. “What do you need, sir?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Help me get everyone to safety. Pole the raft. Be strong. Guard us.” He paused. “And let me not be the only person telling people what to do next.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska nodded. “Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And then…help me kill Mongols.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She studied his determined expression and almost grinned. “Wanageeska kill Mongols? Then I’m right beside you, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Another year, another enemy,” he said. “Let’s get out of here.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Two days later they came across the next riverine signal station. It was identical to the first except for a pervasive sour smell of burned wood and ash that wafted over the river. This time Marcellinus, Hanska, and Taianita stealthily approached the signal tower, creeping through the underbrush that surrounded it with axes and spears at the ready. But the sentry post was undamaged, the small living quarters again abandoned quickly but with no signs of trouble.</p>
<p class="para-p">The smell of old fire came from the tower. The signal fire had been lit and had burned for some time before being quenched.</p>
<p class="para-p">Digging his fingers into the ashes, Marcellinus found them still damp below the surface. From this and from the prints of the Roman caligae sandals in the dust outside the outpost, Hanska estimated this station had been abandoned by its Roman contubernium just two or three days before.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The Kicka River wound on. Now the river valley threaded between high, flat ridges and isolated monadnocks topped with trees. By now they had thrown caution to the winds. Gone were the long nights ashore, resting up behind field fortifications against the Caddo threat. Gone was their fear of the wandering Caddo warrior bands along the riverbanks. They traveled as fast as they were able, poling the raft all day and as far into the night as they could manage and dozing fitfully when they could. Rain and wind no longer kept them ashore. They fished from the craft when they could and went ashore for meat or berries only when their hunger and weakness drove them to it.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page185" title="185"/>
<p class="para-p">The river had grown in width, depth, and reliability. Marcellinus, Taianita, and Enopay had lashed fallen tree trunks to the edges of the raft to serve as outriggers and keep it more stable. Time was critical now. They passed three more Roman signal stations, all deserted, and did not go ashore to investigate them.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Kicka might be larger and wider than the Stream of Piss, but its current was just as wan and provided as little help to them. For all their efforts at poling and paddling, it might have been faster to travel by land, but Bassus was still not strong enough to walk for any length of time. The Chitimachan suggested splitting the party, sending the fittest of them to run ahead. Marcellinus would not hear of it. They were a small enough group as it was, and few of them able-bodied enough to fight should the Caddo attack. Hesperian tribes raided one another all the time to appropriate women of childbearing age. Taianita, the Chitimachan, and even Hanska were still of such an age, and dividing the party would leave them even more at risk. Their little group certainly had nothing else of value.</p>
<p class="para-p">They had to make haste. Marcellinus’s fear that they would be cut off from the Romans by the advancing Mongol army was foremost in all their minds. It could easily happen. Perhaps it already had: the evidence of the deserted signal towers was confirmation that the armies of Chinggis Khan were moving much faster than they were.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“Boat,” the Chitimachan said suddenly in Cahokian and then again in Latin. “Cymba, navis…merda.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska grabbed her ax. Bassus, dozing, came awake all at once and grabbed a spear. Marcellinus, who was poling the raft, snatched the pole up out of the river and held it quarterstaff-style, river water dripping down his arms. He glanced quickly at both banks and then behind him. He feared a Caddo dugout, always feared an assault, but saw nothing.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Far ahead…Gone. Around the next bend.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page186" title="186"/>
<p class="para-p">Bassus peered up at her. “Good God, woman, what type of boat?”</p>
<p class="para-p">She eyed him balefully. “The type with a sail.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Holy fucking Jove…” Marcellinus jammed the pole into the mud at the river bottom so hard that it stuck, jolting the raft. He pulled it free and pushed back at more of an angle.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay picked up a paddle. “Taianita, match me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">On the other side of the raft Taianita dug in, and after a few moments Hanska and the Chitimachan joined them from opposite sides of the raft, scooping with their bare hands.</p>
<p class="para-p">Despite their best efforts, the bend in front of them opened up agonizingly slowly.</p>
<p class="para-p">Bassus sat up, wincing, and peered downriver. “Knarr.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Shit, Eyanosa,” said Enopay. “Be careful.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The raft was rocking dangerously. Marcellinus eased up and squinted. “A knarr? You’re sure? Juno…”</p>
<p class="para-p">Bassus’s face cleared, and for a moment he looked five years younger. The Chitimachan bowed her head, not exactly smiling but at least presenting a look of some relief. Enopay beamed from ear to ear. Marcellinus blew out a long breath. Relief surged through him. Despite the ache in his muscles and the other, different, ache in his belly he felt strong again. Strong.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Odd,” Hanska said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“What? What?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That we are now all so happy to see Romans.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The wide-beamed Norse cargo ship held the contubernia of Roman legionaries of the 27th Augustan from the signal stations they had already passed and a crew of fifteen Roman sailors, their Caddo and Cherokee guides, and a few heavily armed marines of the Legio VI Ferrata. They were a little startled to be hailed in Latin from astern by Marcellinus’s decidedly grubby and unkempt crew, and Marcellinus was equally startled when the centurion in command of the boat walked to its stern and pulled off his helmet. “Manius Ifer?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Ifer met Marcellinus’s eye, then glanced quickly at the other men and women on the raft. His gaze stopped on Hanska, the only other person he could have recognized, then swiveled back to Marcellinus.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page187" title="187"/>
<p class="para-p">The flinty look in Ifer’s eye showed that he remembered their last encounter all too well.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Manius Ifer is who?” Enopay asked quietly.</p>
<p class="para-p">“He tried to steal your longship when we were at the Market of the Mud. Many of his century died in the ensuing battle. I barely stopped Sintikala from killing him.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay raised his eyebrows. “You may regret that.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Let me, then.” Bassus sat up and raised his voice. “Decurion Sextus Bassus of the Legio III Parthian. Survivors here of a Roman expedition to the People of the Hand. Permission to come aboard?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The knarr was fifty feet long and fifteen feet wide. It was capable of carrying over twenty tons of cargo, and its hull seemed cavernous to Marcellinus. After piling into it, they left the dilapidated and much-repaired raft that had been their home for the last months floating at the water’s edge. None of them looked back as the knarr sailed on.</p>
<p class="para-p">Ifer scrutinized him. “Gaius Marcellinus. Perhaps I should tie you up. For old time’s sake.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Or perhaps you should help me get back to Cahokia so that I can tell our Imperator what I know of the Mongol Khan and his plan of attack.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The other Romans on the knarr looked at one another and shook their heads. Ifer looked somber. “Trust me, we’re fully aware of the Khan’s intentions.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What has happened?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Defeat,” Ifer said tersely. “Mongol ships, scores of them in the dawn, out of nowhere. An entire fleet of Mongol and Jin battle junks. Some longboats of the People of the Sun assisting, and other big painted Hesperian canoes as well, provided by their allies the Tlingit, made of solid wood, much stouter than the usual birch-bark crap. They launched a surprise assault on the fortress of the Sixth in the great gulf. Blasted the fortress walls with bombs of Jin salt and sank two quinqueremes. The rest fled.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page188" title="188"/>
<p class="para-p">“Fled? Our warships?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Ifer nodded, his eyes guarded. “Afraid so. Verus’s orders. Save the fleet. So the Mongols sailed on, laid waste to the Market of the Mud, and kept going. The bastards are somewhere ahead of us now.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Ahead?” Enopay said. “Upriver of us on the Mizipi already? Futete…” Ifer looked at him with the usual surprise Romans showed at finding a Hesperian speaking such fluent Latin.</p>
<p class="para-p">“We know how the Mongols managed that,” Marcellinus said. “Portage. Down in the land of the Yokot’an Maya, Nova Hesperia narrows to an isthmus fifty miles across. There, the slaves of the People of the Sun hauled the Mongol battle junks across deerskins coated with oil.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We suspected something of the kind.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You were there when the Mongol fleet attacked?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“My century was off on operations, west of the Market of the Mud. The Sixth picked us up when they came through.” Ifer shook his head grimly. “The Cherokee scouted ahead while we gathered everyone in, evacuating the troops from the signal stations. The river is blockaded north of us, at…Shappa Ta’atan? You know of it? I have not been so far north.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan had split the Roman forces in two. “Of course. We’re cut off from Cahokia?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Aye, until we run the blockade. Smash through, reunite with the Third and 27th.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“If you do,” Enopay said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Ifer frowned at the boy. “What did you say?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Does the Imperator know?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The centurion shook his head with frustration. “Of course he doesn’t know, boy. How could he? The Mongols are <em class="char-i">ahead</em> of us, between us and Cahokia. Weren’t you listening?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You should send runners.” Enopay turned to Marcellinus. “Divide and divide and conquer and conquer. The Khan hopes to put wedges between the Roman forces in the south <em class="char-i">and</em> in the north. If the Mongols destroy the rest of our fleet, they can not only split the Sixth from the other two legions but strand the Third and most of the 27th on the wrong side of the Mizipi. Cut them off from the Chesapica completely. We need to warn Hadrianus.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page189" title="189"/>
<p class="para-p">“Shit,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“<em class="char-i">Our</em> fleet?” Ifer said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay met his gaze. “Are we not allies?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Ifer shrugged. “Anyway, we’ll get through, and we’ll get to Cahokia long before runners.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Ifer’s helmsman broke into the conversation. “Next fort.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sure enough, the next Roman signal station had just come into view around the bend ahead of them. A contubernium of legionaries stood on its top platform. One of them waved.</p>
<p class="para-p">Ifer nodded at Marcellinus and Bassus and stood to go to the prow of the knarr. Bassus grunted. “This boat is going to get crowded.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus noted that the legionaries of the Sixth were staring openly at Taianita and the Chitimachan, perhaps the first comely women they had seen for months. Taianita was staring steadfastly ahead, ignoring them all, but the Chitimachan looked as though she was very close to punching someone.</p>
<p class="para-p">That might at least provide some light relief. The rest of the news was unspeakably grim.</p>
<p class="para-p">Having the Roman forces divided was obviously intolerable. But to lose control of the Mizipi so quickly and completely? He had not fully considered the implications of that.</p>
<p class="para-p">Evidently his feelings of relief had come too soon.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">Much</em> too soon.</p></div></body></html>

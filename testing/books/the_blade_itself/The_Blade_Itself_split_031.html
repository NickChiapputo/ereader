<div id="filepos816177" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Questions</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta heaped porridge into his mouth as fast as he could, hoping to get half a meal’s worth down before his gorge began to rise. He swallowed, coughed, shuddered. He shoved the bowl away, as though its very presence offended him. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Which, in fact, it does.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “This had better be important, Severard,” he grumbled.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Practical scraped his greasy hair back with one hand. “Depends what you mean by important. It’s about our magical friends.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, the First of the Magi and his bold companions. What about them?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There was some manner of a disturbance at their chambers last night. Someone broke in, they say. There was a fight of some sort. Seems as if some damage was done.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Someone? Some sort? Some damage?” Glokta gave a disapproving shake of his head. “Seems? Seems isn’t good enough for us, Severard.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well it’ll have to be, this time. The guard was a little thin on the details. Looked damn worried, if you ask me.” Severard sprawled a little deeper into his chair, shoulders hunching up around his ears. “Someone needs to go and look into it, might as well be us. You can get a good look at them, close up. Ask them some questions, maybe.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Where are they?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’ll love this. The Tower of Chains.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta scowled as he sucked a few bits of porridge from his empty gums. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Of course. And right at the top, I bet. Lots of steps.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Anything else?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Northman went for a stroll yesterday, walked in circles round half the Agriont. We watched him, of course.” The Practical sniffed and adjusted his mask. “Ugly bastard.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, the infamous Northman. Did he commit any outrages? Rape and murder, buildings aflame, that type of thing?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not much, being honest. A tedious morning for everyone. Wandered around and gawped at things. He spoke to a couple of people.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Anyone we know?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No one important. One of the carpenters working on the stands for the Contest. A clerk on the Kingsway. There was some girl near the University. He spoke to her for a while.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A girl?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Severard’s eyes grinned. “That’s right, and a nice-looking one too. What was her name?” He snapped his fingers. “I made sure I found it out. Her brother’s with the King’s Own… West, something West…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ardee.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s the one! You know her?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hmm.” Glokta licked at his empty gums. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">She asked me how I was. I remember.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “What did they have to talk about?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Practical raised his eyebrows. “Probably nothing. She’s from Angland though, not been in the city long. Might be some connection. You want me to bring her in? We could soon find out.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No!” snapped Glokta. “No. No need. Her brother used to be a friend of mine.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Used to be.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No one touches her, Severard, you hear?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Practical shrugged. “If you say so, Inquisitor. If you say so.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I do.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a pause. “So we’re done with the Mercers then, are we?” Severard sounded almost wistful.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It would seem so. They’re finished. Nothing but some cleaning up to do.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Some lucrative cleaning up, I daresay.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I daresay,” said Glokta sourly. “But his Eminence feels our talents will be better used elsewhere.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Like watching fake wizards.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Hope you didn’t lose out on your little property by the docks.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Severard shrugged. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you need somewhere away from prying eyes again, before too long. It’ll still be there. At the right price. Shame to leave a job half done is all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">True.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta paused for a moment, considering. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Dangerous. The Arch Lector said go no further. Very dangerous, to disobey, and yet I smell something. It niggles, to leave a loose end, whatever his Eminence might say. </span></span><span class="calibre3">“There might be one more thing.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Really?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, but keep it subtle. Do you know anything about banks?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Big buildings. They lend people money.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta gave a thin smile. “I had no idea you were such an expert. There’s one in particular I’m interested in. Name of Valint and Balk.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Never heard of them, but I can ask around.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Just keep it discreet, Severard, do you understand me? No one can know about this. I mean it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Discretion is what I’m all about, chief, ask anyone. Discreet. That’s me. Known for it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’d better be, Severard. You had better be.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Or it could be both our heads.</span></span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta sat, wedged into the embrasure with his back against the stones and his left leg stretched out in front of him—a searing, pulsing furnace of pain. He expected pain of course, every moment of every day. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But this is something just a bit special.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Every breath was a rattling moan through rigid jaws. Every tiniest movement was a mighty task. He remembered how Marshal Varuz had made him run up and down these steps when he was training for the Contest, years ago. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I took them three at a time, up and down without a second thought. Now look at me. Who would have thought it could come to this?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">His trembling body ran with sweat, his stinging eyes ran with tears, his burning nose dripped watery snot. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">All this water flowing out of me, and yet I’m thirsty as hell. Where’s the sense in that?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Where was the sense in any of it? </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">What if someone should come past, and see me like this? The terrifying scourge of the Inquisition, flopped on his arse in a window, barely able to move? Will I force a nonchalant smile onto this rigid mask of agony? Will I pretend that all is well? That I often come here, to sprawl beside the stairs? Or will I weep and scream and beg for help?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But no one passed. He lay there, wedged in that narrow space, three-quarters of the way up the Tower of Chains, the back of his head resting on the cool stones, his trembling knees drawn up in front of him. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Sand dan Glokta, master swordsman, dashing cavalry officer, what glorious future might he have in front of him? There was a time when I could run for hours. Run and run and never tire.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He could feel a trickle of sweat running down his back. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Why do I do this? Why the hell would anyone do this? I could stop today. I could go home to mother. But then what? Then what?</span></span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Inquisitor, I’m glad you’re here.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Good for you, bastard. I’m not.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta leaned against the wall at the top of the stairs, such teeth as he had grinding against his gums.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They’re inside, it’s quite a mess…” Glokta’s hand trembled, the tip of his cane rattling against the stones. His head swam. The guard was blurry and dim through his twitching eyelids. “Are you alright?” He loomed forwards, one arm outstretched.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta looked up. “Just get the fucking door, fool!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The man jumped away, hurried to the door and pushed it open. Every part of Glokta longed to give up and sprawl on his face, but he willed himself upright. He forced one foot before the other, forced his breath to come even, forced his shoulders back and his head high, and swept imperiously past the guard, every part of his body singing with pain. What he saw beyond the doors almost broke his veneer of composure however.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Yesterday these were some of the finest rooms in the Agriont. They were reserved for the most honoured of guests, the most important of foreign dignitaries. Yesterday.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> A gaping hole was ripped out of one wall where the window should have been, the sky beyond blinding bright after the darkness of the stairwell. A section of the ceiling had collapsed, broken timbers and shreds of plaster hanging down into the room. The floor was strewn with chunks of stone, splinters of glass, torn fragments of coloured cloth. The antique furniture had been smashed to scattered pieces, broken edges charred and blackened as if by fire. Only one chair, half a table, and a tall ornamental jar, strangely pristine in the middle of the rubble-strewn floor, had escaped the destruction.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">In the midst of this expensive wreckage stood a confused and sickly-seeming young man. He looked up as Glokta picked his way through the rubble round the doorway, tongue darting nervously over his lips, evidently on edge. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Has anyone ever looked more of a fraud?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Er, good morning?” The young man’s fingers twitched nervously at his gown, a heavy thing, stitched with arcane symbols. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And doesn’t he look uncomfortable in it? If this man is a wizard’s apprentice, I am the Emperor of Gurkhul.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I am Glokta. From his Majesty’s Inquisition. I have been sent to investigate this… unfortunate business. I was expecting someone older.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, yes, sorry, I am Malacus Quai,” stammered the young man, “apprentice to great Bayaz, the First of the Magi, great in high art and learned in deep—” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Kneel, kneel before me! I am the mighty Emperor of Gurkhul!</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Malacus…” Glokta cut him off rudely “…Quai. You are from the Old Empire?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Why yes,” the young man brightened slightly at that. “Do you know my—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No. Not at all.” The pale face sagged. “Were you here last night?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Er, yes, I was asleep, next door. I’m afraid I didn’t see anything though…” Glokta stared at him, intent and unblinking, trying to work him out. The apprentice coughed and looked at the floor, as if wondering what to clean up first. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Can this really make the Arch Lector nervous? A miserable actor. His whole manner reeks of deception.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Someone saw something, though?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, erm, Master Ninefingers, I suppose—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ninefingers?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, our Northern companion.” The young man brightened. “A warrior of great renown, a champion, a prince among his—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You, from the Old Empire. He, a Northman. What a cosmopolitan band you are.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well yes, ha ha, we do, I suppose—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Where is Ninefingers now?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Still asleep I think, er, I could wake him—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Would you be so kind?” Glokta tapped his cane on the floor. “It was quite a climb, and I would rather not come back later.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No, er, of course… sorry” He hastened over to one of the doors and Glokta turned away, pretending to examine the gaping wound in the wall while grimacing in agony and biting his lip to keep from wailing like a sick child. He seized hold of the broken stones at the edge of the hole with his free hand, squeezing them as hard as he could.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">As the spasm passed he began to take more interest in the damage. Even this high up the wall was a good four feet thick, solidly built from rubble bonded with mortar, faced with cut stone blocks. It would take a rock from a truly mighty catapult to make such a breach, or a team of strong workmen going night and day for a week. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A giant siege engine or a group of labourers would doubtless have attracted the attention of the guards. So how was it made?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta ran his hand over the cracked stones. He had once heard rumours that in the far south they made a kind of blasting powder. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Could a little powder have done this?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The door opened and Glokta turned to see a big man ducking under the low lintel, buttoning his shirt with slow, heavy hands. A thoughtful kind of slowness. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">As if he could move quickly but doesn’t see the point.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> His hair was a tangled mass, his lumpy face badly scarred. The middle finger of his left hand was missing. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Hence Ninefingers. How very imaginative.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Sleeping late?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Northman nodded. “Your city is too hot for me—it keeps me up at night and makes me sleepy in the day.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta’s leg was throbbing, his back was groaning, his neck was stiff as a dry branch. It was all he could do to keep his agony a secret. He would have given anything to sprawl in that one undamaged chair and scream his head off. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But I must stand, and trade words with these charlatans.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Could you explain to me what happened here?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ninefingers shrugged. “I needed to piss in the night. I saw someone in the room.” He had little trouble with the common tongue, it seemed, even if the content was hardly polite.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Did you see who this someone was?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No. It was a woman, I saw that much.” He worked his shoulders, clearly uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A woman, really?” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">This story becomes more ridiculous by the second.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Anything else? Can we narrow our search beyond half the population?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It was cold. Very cold.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Cold?” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Of course, why not? On one of the hottest nights of the year.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta stared into the Northman’s eyes for a long time, and he stared back. Dark, cool blue eyes, deeply set. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Not the eyes of an idiot. He may look an ape, but he doesn’t talk like one. He thinks before he speaks, then says no more than he has to. This is a dangerous man.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What is your business in the city, Master Ninefingers?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I came with Bayaz. If you want to know his business you can ask him. Honestly, I don’t know.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He pays you then?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You follow him out of loyalty?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not exactly.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But you are his servant?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No. Not really.” The Northman scratched slowly at his stubbly jaw. “I don’t know what I am.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A big, ugly liar is what you are. But how to prove it?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta waved his cane around the shattered chamber. “How did your intruder cause so much damage?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bayaz did that.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He did? How?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Art, he calls it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Art?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Base magic is wild and dangerous,” intoned the apprentice pompously, as though he were saying something of great importance, “for it comes from the Other Side, and to touch the world below is fraught with peril. The Magus tempers magic with knowledge, and thus produces High Art, but like the smith or the—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Other Side?” snapped Glokta, putting a sharp end to the young moron’s stream of drivel. “The world below? Hell, do you mean? Magic? Do you know any magic, Master Ninefingers?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Me?” The Northman chuckled. “No.” He thought about it for a moment and then added, almost as an afterthought, “I can speak to the spirits though.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The spirits, is that so?” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">For pity’s sake.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Perhaps they could tell us who this intruder was?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m afraid not.” Ninefingers shook his head sadly, either missing Glokta’s sarcasm or choosing to ignore it. “There are none left awake in this place. They are sleeping here. They have been for a long time.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, of course.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Well past spirits’ bedtime. I tire of this nonsense.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “You come from Bethod?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You could say that.” It was Glokta who was surprised. He had expected at best a sharp intake of breath, a hurried effort at concealment, not a frank admission. Ninefingers did not even blink however. “I was once his champion.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Champion?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I fought ten duels for him.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta groped for words. “Did you win?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I was lucky.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You realise, of course, that Bethod has invaded the Union?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I do.” Ninefingers sighed. “I should have killed that bastard long ago, but I was young then, and stupid. Now I doubt I’ll get another chance, but that’s the way of things. You have to be… what’s the word for it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Realistic,” said Quai.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta frowned. A moment ago, he had teetered on the brink of making sense of all this nonsense, but the moment had slipped away and things made less sense than ever. He stared at Ninefingers, but that scarred face held no answers, only more questions. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Talking with spirits? Bethod’s champion but his enemy? Assaulted by a mysterious woman in the dead of night? And he doesn’t even know why he’s here? A clever liar tells as much truth as he can, but this one tells so many lies I hardly know where to begin.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, we have a guest!” An old man stepped into the room, thickset and stocky with a short grey beard, vigorously rubbing his bald head with a cloth. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">So this is Bayaz.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He threw himself down in the one intact chair, moving with none of the grace one would expect from an important historical figure. “I must apologise. I was taking advantage of the bath. A very fine bath. I have been bathing every day since we arrived here at the Agriont. I grew so besmirched with the dirt of the road that I have positively seized upon the opportunity to be clean again.” The old man rubbed his hand over his hairless scalp with a faint hissing sound.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta mentally compared his features to those of Bayaz’ statue in the Kingsway. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">There is hardly anything uncanny about the resemblance. Half as commanding and a great deal shorter. Given an hour I could find five old men who looked more convincing. If I took a razor to Arch Lector Sult, I could do better.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta glanced at his shiny pate. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I wonder if he takes a razor to that every morning?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And you are?” asked the supposed Bayaz.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Inquisitor Glokta.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, one of His Majesty’s Inquisitors. We are honoured!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh no, the honour is mine. You, after all, are the legendary Bayaz, First of the Magi.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man glared back at him, his green eyes prickly hard. “Legendary is perhaps a shade too much, but I am Bayaz.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Your companion, Master Ninefingers, was just describing last night’s events to me. A colourful tale. He claims that you caused… all this.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man snorted. “I am not in the habit of welcoming uninvited guests.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So I see.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Alas, there was some damage to the suite. In my experience one should act quickly and decisively. The pieces can always be picked up afterward.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course. Forgive my ignorance, Master Bayaz, but how, precisely, was the damage caused?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man smiled. “You can understand that we do not share the secrets of our order with just anyone, and I am afraid that I already have an apprentice.” He indicated the unconvincing youth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We met. In simple terms then, perhaps, that I might understand?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You would call it magic.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Magic. I see.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Indeed. It is, after all, what we Magi are best known for.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Mmm. I don’t suppose you would be kind enough to demonstrate, for my benefit?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh no!” The so-called wizard gave a comfortable laugh. “I don’t do tricks.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">This old fool is as hard to fathom as the Northman. The one barely speaks, while the other talks and talks but says nothing.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “I must admit to being somewhat at a loss as to how this intruder got in.” Glokta glanced round the room, examining the possible means of entrance. “The guard saw nothing, which leaves the window.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He shuffled cautiously to the hole and peered out. There had been a small balcony, but a few stubby splinters of stone were all that remained. Otherwise the wall fell smooth and sheer all the way to the glittering water far, far below. “That’s quite a climb to make, especially in a dress. An impossible one, wouldn’t you say? How do you think this woman made it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man snorted. “Do you want me to do your job for you? Perhaps she clambered up the latrine chute!” The Northman looked deeply troubled by that suggestion. “Why don’t you catch her and ask her? Isn’t that what you’re here for?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Touchy, touchy, and consummately acted. An air of injured innocence so convincing, he almost has me believing this garbage. Almost, but not quite.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Therein lies the problem. There is no sign of your mysterious intruder. No body has been recovered. Some wood, small pieces of furniture, the stones from the wall, they were scattered widely in the streets below. But nothing of any intruder, of either sex.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man stared back at him, a hard frown beginning to form on his face. “Perhaps the body burned to nothing. Perhaps it was torn apart, into pieces too small to see, or boiled away into the air. Magic is not always precise, or predictable, even in the hands of a master. Such things can happen. Easily. Particularly when I become annoyed.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I fear I must risk your annoyance, though. It has occurred to me that you might not, in fact, be Bayaz, the First of the Magi.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Indeed?” The old man’s bushy eyebrows drew together.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I must at least entertain the possibility…” a tense stillness had settled on the room “…that you are an impostor.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A fraud?” snapped the so-called Magus. The pale young man lowered his head and backed quietly away towards the wall. Glokta felt suddenly very alone in the midst of that rubble strewn circle, alone and increasingly unsure of himself, but he soldiered on.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It had occurred to me that this whole event might have been staged for our benefit. A convenient demonstration of your magical powers.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Convenient?” Hissed the bald old man, his voice unnaturally loud. “Convenient, say you? It would be convenient if I was left to enjoy a night’s sleep uninterrupted. Convenient if I was now sitting in my old chair on the Closed Council. Convenient if people took my word as law, the way they used to, without asking a lot of damn fool questions!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The resemblance to the statue on the Kingsway was suddenly much increased. There, now, was the frown of command, the sneer of contempt, the threat of terrible anger. The old man’s words seemed to press on Glokta like a great weight, driving the breath from his body, threatening to crush him to his knees, cutting into his skull, and leaving behind a creeping shred of doubt. He glanced up at the yawning hole in the wall. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Powder? Catapults? Labourers? Is there not a simpler explanation?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The world seemed to shift around him, as it had in the Arch Lector’s study a few days before, his mind turned the pieces, pulling them apart, putting them together. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">What if they are simply telling the truth? What if…</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">No!</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta forced the idea from his mind. He lifted his head and gave the old man a sneer of his own to think about. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">An aging actor with a shaved head and a plausible manner. Nothing more.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “If you are as you say, you have nothing to fear from my questions, or from your answers.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man cracked a smile and the strange pressure was suddenly released. “Your candour at least, Inquisitor, is quite refreshing. No doubt you will do your utmost to prove your theory. I wish you luck. I, as you say, have nothing to fear. I would only ask that you find some proof of this deception before bothering us again.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta bowed stiffly. “I will try to do so,” he said, and made for the door.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There is one more thing!” The old man was looking towards the gaping hole in the wall. “Would it be possible to find some other chambers? The wind blows rather chill through these.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I will look into it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good. Perhaps somewhere with fewer steps. Damn things play hell with my knees these days.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Indeed? There, at least, we can agree.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta gave the three of them one last inspection. The bald old man stared back, his face a blank wall. The lanky youth glanced up anxiously then quickly turned away. The Northman was still frowning towards the latrine door. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Charlatans, impostors, spies. But how to prove it?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Good day, gentlemen.” And he limped towards the stairs with as much dignity as he could muster.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_31"></div></div></body>

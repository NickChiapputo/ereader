<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">O</span>f course, the secret of the Mongol presence in Nova Hesperia could not keep forever. In the Roman month of Julius, known locally as the Heat Moon, when the humidity had built to an almost unbearable degree and the mosquitoes were at their height and the <em class="char-i">Concordia</em> got back from its latest trip up the Wemissori, the dam broke. It was as if the gigantic continent had suddenly become too small to contain all the warring nations within it.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Two new waterwheels had been installed in Cahokia Creek in the springtime. On hearing of the project over dinner one evening, Decinius Sabinus had offered to lend the city some Roman carpenters and engineers to speed the work along—an efficient flour milling operation was in everyone’s interest—but Tahtay and Marcellinus had declined out of pride. The millstones and runner stones, the wooden gearing, and the millhouses that kept the enterprise safe from storms were entirely products of Cahokian craftsmanship, as overseen by Marcellinus, and they were inordinately proud of them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s brickworks and steelworks had been largely staffed by men and boys. Likewise, when he had refurbished the <em class="char-i">Concordia</em> in the Longhouse of the Ship his craftsmen had been predominantly male. The mills were a very different matter. In Cahokia, women ground the corn, women had very strong opinions about how the flour mills should work, and once the mills were operational, they were run entirely by women and girls.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page36" title="36"/>
<p class="para-p">So it was that when the <em class="char-i">Concordia</em> returned, Marcellinus was helping to fine-tune the third and largest waterwheel with several dozen Cahokian women, with not a single other man in sight. It had to be said that he was enjoying the change of pace and picking up some interesting Cahokian vocabulary to boot, as the women were unblushingly specific on many topics Marcellinus previously had given little thought to. Nahimana was there, hobbling in some pain from her hip but nonetheless bossing the other women around with a proficiency and profanity that any centurion would envy.</p>
<p class="para-p">Even Kangee was on the team, in a brief truce with Marcellinus that might not extend as far as a smile but at least allowed a measure of neutral conversation. And it was Kangee who first looked up and said, “Big canoe.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus wiped the sweat from his face. Sure enough, the <em class="char-i">Concordia</em> was nosing its way up the creek, with Akecheta at the helm and eight rather fierce-looking Blackfoot warriors standing at the prow, staring out with expressions of almost religious awe.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus turned to try to see it through their eyes. After all these years he had grown so used to Cahokia’s Great Mound that he had stopped seeing it for what it was: a monumental earthwork, an incredible engineering feat. A hundred feet tall, a thousand feet across at the base, it contained millions of cubic feet of earth and must have taken countless years of dedicated effort to construct. The three giant launch rails that ran parallel up its northern slope also might inspire awe. For that matter, the Longhouse of the Thunderbirds at the foot of the mound and the Longhouse of the Wings at its crown were probably the largest buildings the Blackfoot had ever seen. And beyond all that was the steelworks, puffing gouts of heavy smoke into the skies that drifted away over the bluffs. It was a shame the Raven clan and its Roman apprentices did not also have a Sky Lantern or two floating above the scene to complete the effect.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page37" title="37"/>
<p class="para-p">As the <em class="char-i">Concordia</em> pulled in at the Longhouse of the Ship, Napayshni stepped out with the rope to moor the drekar. He still limped from the wound he had received fighting the Panther clan of the Shappa Ta’atani years before. The rowers shipped their oars and stood to stretch their weary arms and shoulders.</p>
<p class="para-p">A lone brave was racing down the rearward slope of the Great Mound. From his fleetness of foot and his red sash, Marcellinus knew it was Tahtay. As soon as they caught sight of him, the Blackfoot warriors whooped and vaulted out of the longship to sprint toward him. They moved astonishingly fast despite the cloying humidity of high summer.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now Marcellinus could see two Blackfoot elders sitting more sedately in the stern, and alongside them the stooped figure of the headman of the Hidatsa, the chieftain who two years earlier had permitted them to go on the Plains buffalo hunt that had led them to Tahtay. The headman’s price for this assistance had been to see the Great City before he died, and Cahokia paid its debts. Beside him stood Sooleawa, the buffalo caller of the Hidatsa, in her elk-skin dress and hair band of buffalo hide, her loose black hair blowing freely in the Hidatsa style.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now they stepped ashore, moving their heads back and forth almost comically. They resembled nothing so much as Roman farmers from the sticks stepping into the marbled Forum for the first time.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay and the Blackfoot warriors met halfway between the foot of the mound and Cahokia Creek, and an involuntary dance of glee broke out. Marcellinus smiled. Tahtay had grown so serious since the Romans had arrived. Even with Taianita and Dustu often by his side, he had so few friends that it was a joy to see him with his Fire Heart brothers.</p>
<p class="para-p">However, when Tahtay summoned Marcellinus just after the evening meal, his face was stony enough to grind corn. Marcellinus walked into the war chief’s house on the flat top of the Mound of the Sun to find Tahtay sitting with Enopay, Taianita, Dustu, and the Blackfoot warriors and elders around a mess of bowls of corn, fish bones, hazelnut cakes, and tea. The Blackfoot warriors studied Marcellinus intently, their elders ignored him, Taianita lolled back frowning, and Enopay wouldn’t meet his eye at all.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page38" title="38"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was wearing a Cahokian tunic. Tahtay shook his head. “Dress in your Roman clothes. We go to Hadrianus.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Now, Tahtay? Why?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay stared at him with dead eyes. “There is trouble in the west. Fetch your Roman tunic and cloak and come back.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus drew himself up and saluted. “Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Something was very wrong. The Blackfoot had brought news, and it was not good.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Romans ate later in the evening than Cahokians did, and the Imperator and Praetors dined even later than their men, and so Marcellinus and the others arrived at the Praetorium building of the Third Parthica to find Hadrianus still at table. Tahtay requested entry courteously enough, his face now more sad than angry.</p>
<p class="para-p">They were just three: Tahtay, Taianita, and Marcellinus. A fourth, a Blackfoot friend of Tahtay’s, had helped paddle the canoe the half mile across the Mizipi, but he had stayed with the boat. None of the Hesperians had spoken to Marcellinus during the journey, and he felt very much at a disadvantage as they were ushered into the Imperial presence by a Praetorian in full armor. He was surprised that Tahtay had brought only Taianita and discomfited that the war chief had not included Sintikala, Chenoa, or Kanuna, Cahokians with far more gravitas.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus looked just as surprised to see them. Decinius Sabinus was there, along with two tribunes Marcellinus did not know. He breathed a quiet sigh of relief that Agrippa apparently was dining in his own castra. Whatever was going on, it would surely be easier to resolve without the Praetor of the 27th in attendance.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Tahtay and Taianita, welcome,” said the Imperator. “An unexpected pleasure. And Gaius Marcellinus.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Caesar.” Marcellinus bowed.</p>
<p class="para-p">Decinius Sabinus got to his feet and bowed to Taianita, who smiled back at him. Marcellinus blinked. Both men knew her?</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus waved at the table behind him. “You will take wine?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I will,” Tahtay said to Marcellinus’s surprise, and moved to the table to pour. Equally unexpectedly, Taianita strolled over to the Imperator’s couch and perched on the end of it. Neither Hadrianus, Sabinus, nor his two tribunes reacted to this overfamiliarity, and with a moment of shock Marcellinus realized that Tahtay and Taianita were now more frequent visitors to the Imperator’s table than he might have supposed.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page39" title="39"/>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay brought wine and water to Marcellinus, handed a beaker to Taianita, then turned to the Imperator. “And so, Hadrianus, my friend, once again you have lied to me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator’s face was slightly red. It was not the drink but the blazing Hesperian sun of high summer. His sunburn and quizzical smile made him look a little comical. “Never before have I met a man who owned as little trust as you, Tahtay of Cahokia.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay gave a short sharp laugh. “Trust? You say so? Futete!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Certainly.” Hadrianus raised his cup in toast. “As best I recall, I have not broken a promise to you this entire moon.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Huh.” Tahtay sipped his wine and for a moment seemed lost in thought. Then he nodded and spoke. “I am much saddened, Caesar. Truly, my heart grieves. Despite all the pain and violence between our peoples, over recent months I had begun to have hope. I had thought perhaps we were finally coming to an understanding, you and I. That this might not all end in bloodshed and ruin between your Romans and my people. But that is not so, is it?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sabinus looked wary. Hadrianus’s smile faded. “Tahtay, you will need to stop speaking in riddles if you expect me to answer.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“There are many more Romans than you have told us of,” Tahtay said. “Many, many more. You have tried to delude me into believing your army will one day march away into the Grass, but they have shown few signs of doing so. And today I know why. It is because other Roman legions have already arrived, far to the west past the Great Mountains. They have slain thousands upon thousands of Hesperians and enslaved the rest. The rivers are running with blood, Caesar. The land itself is weeping.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay stood upright, his face calm and his body controlled, but Marcellinus knew he must be surging with strong emotions to be using such words.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus and his Praetor and tribunes sat so still that they might have been carved in stone. Tahtay nodded. “From your eyes I see that I am right.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page40" title="40"/>
<p class="para-p">Now the Imperator leaned forward, his expression intent. “Where are they, these new armies you speak of? How do you know of them?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I am a <em class="char-i">savage</em>,” Tahtay said brutally. “I am a <em class="char-i">barbarian</em>. I am a <em class="char-i">redskin</em>. So you call me, and perhaps I am. But I am not a fool, Caesar. Far from it. I can see that you have long known of this, and that confirmation is all I needed.” He drained his beaker and tossed it aside, and it clattered across the floor. “I must go and summon the clan chiefs and elders and decide what must be done. Because if Roma has already taken the west, you have lied to me from the very start. You have no need to leave Cahokia. Ever. And that, Cahokia cannot tolerate.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Wait, Tahtay.” Hadrianus swung his legs off the couch. “I beg of you: tell me what you know. I am in earnest. Please answer me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay’s brow furrowed. He said nothing.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You may tell him, Gaius Marcellinus.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked carefully at his Imperator. “You release me from the oath I swore to you before Roma and Cahokia buried the ax?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, yes, Marcellinus; you may speak candidly to Tahtay about the threat we face. Perhaps he will believe it more readily from you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Still Marcellinus hesitated. “We should call a council of the elders. All should—”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay spun and fixed him with a glare. “<em class="char-i">Merda</em>, Hotah! Tell me <em class="char-i">now</em>!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“They are not Romans,” Marcellinus said. “The armies that have landed on Hesperia’s western shores are Roma’s implacable enemy, and will soon become enemies of Cahokia as they sweep across the land, destroying all in their path.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay eyed him unblinking. Marcellinus went on. “They are called Mongols, and they are utterly ruthless. They come from a continent we call Asia, far across the ocean to the west. In Asia the Mongols have already defeated many nations—great kingdoms, territories of mighty chiefs, in all as broad in extent as the land from the Mizipi to the Atlanticus.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page41" title="41"/>
<p class="para-p">Decinius Sabinus nodded, but everyone else in the room still stood or sat as if frozen. Marcellinus continued. “Caesar and his armies have fought long wars with the Mongols in Asia, trying to hold their forces in check and prevent them from sweeping over Europa and sacking its cities. Tahtay, I swear the truth of this to you. The Mongols are great warriors. They fight on horses, the same four-legs the Romans use. Their war chief, Chinggis Khan, is here to command his armies in person, just as Caesar commands the armies of Roma. And if the Mongols have already taken the whole western coast of Hesperia, and if the Blackfoot know of them now, it cannot be long before they break out beyond the Great Mountains and come flooding across the prairie to attack us here.”</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">“Merda…”</em> Taianita frowned, shook her head, and gestured to Marcellinus: <em class="char-i">Speak true?</em></p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus held her gaze and hand-talked back: <em class="char-i">I speak true. Wanageeska swears</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay’s eyes were wide. “Hotah, you, too, have fought these Mongols?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No.” Marcellinus had faced the armies of Kara Khitai, steppe warriors of a similar vein to the Mongols, and he had partnered with the Chernye Klobuki and Polovtsians of southern Rus. He was familiar with the horsemen of Asia but had never seen the armies of the Great Khan in battle. “But about the Mongols you may believe these men of Roma and what they say.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Asia is a <em class="char-i">huge</em> land,” Decinius Sabinus said. “Marcellinus may be too cautious on this score. The sum of the Mongol homelands, added to their conquests of the Jin and Song Empires, may well be larger in extent than <em class="char-i">all</em> of Nova Hesperia. And when the Mongols swept over the Asian lands before we beat them back, they must have slain twenty million people. That is twenty thousand-thousand.” He looked at Hadrianus. “More, you think?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator shrugged. “Who’s to say? Millions upon millions of the Song alone.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Why? Why?” Tahtay shook his head. “It makes no sense. What would such men want? We do not know them. Why would they attack us?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page42" title="42"/>
<p class="para-p">“Because that is what the Mongols do, Tahtay. They conquer.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It is true.” Marcellinus nodded. “War chief, we must hold a council. The Imperator and his Praetors, and myself, and you and your elders and clan chiefs. We must prepare for the Mongols. All of us together, as one.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay looked at Hadrianus, then at Sabinus. Marcellinus hoped that the war chief wasn’t entering one of his funks. Again Marcellinus wished Kimimela were there; she could push him out of such states with a well-chosen word, often an insult. But Kimimela was across the river in Cahokia, and Taianita appeared lost in thought.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now she raised her head. “Caesar. Speak. If this true, why you not tell us from very start?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus gestured to Marcellinus, who said, “The Imperator and his Praetors believed it would weaken their negotiating position with you and…complicate matters.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“<em class="char-i">All</em> my Praetors,” Hadrianus said. “As I recall, Gaius Marcellinus, you were in full agreement.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita turned to stare at Marcellinus.</p>
<p class="para-p">“It’s true,” Marcellinus said. “I agreed, and at the Imperator’s bidding I swore an oath not to tell Cahokia of the Mongols. An oath he has now relieved me of.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay was gazing past Marcellinus at the wall behind him, but the look of scorn on Taianita’s face cut Marcellinus like a pugio blade.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Worse than you?” Tahtay said at last. “The Mongols are worse than Romans? Worse than the Iroqua at their most terrible? Is that even possible?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sabinus smiled tightly. “Oh, yes, war chief. Did we not make peace with you, for all our flaws? Are we not talking now? The Mongols would make no such peace. The Mongols do not negotiate. They ride to war on their four-legs in the tens of thousands and cut down everyone in their path. If the Mongols had come to Cahokia in our place, they would have slaughtered or enslaved every person in your city. There would have been no discussion, no embassies or parleys or last-minute treaty mongering. I have seen them with my own eyes, and I give you my word: the Mongol Khan and his Horde are the most vicious and ruthless enemy I have ever faced.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page43" title="43"/>
<p class="para-p">“Roma is kindness itself by comparison,” Hadrianus said sardonically.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Huh.” Finally, Tahtay met the Imperator’s eye. After a long moment, he turned to Marcellinus. “These are all true words, Wanageeska? On your honor, on your oath?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes,” Marcellinus said. “I swear by all the people I love, all—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You would swear on your daughter’s life?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Again the room went very quiet. The Imperator raised his eyebrows. Sabinus looked back and forth between Marcellinus and Tahtay. Taianita, her eyes large, now looked at the floor.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus tried to keep his expression neutral. “Yes, I so swear.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay studied him intently, then nodded.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus rose and went to fetch the pitcher of wine himself. “And now, Tahtay, please tell me more of what you have heard from the western reaches of Nova Hesperia.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Death,” Tahtay said. “Cruel men in armor who ride horses and trample the people. They have killed countless Hesperians, laid waste to entire villages and towns, slain whole tribes. Others they have chained and forced to mine gold from the rivers and mountains.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sabinus nodded. “Merciless. Just as I said.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“In what numbers? How many Mongols and where?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay shrugged. “Was Enopay there to count? No. We do not know how many. More than enough to smash the tribes all up and down the western seacoast. They are <em class="char-i">everywhere</em>, Caesar. They are in the north, where the winters are cold and the peoples carve and paint tall poles in bright colors. They are in the south, where it is always warm and the people fish and eat clams and live in plenty. I knew little of these peoples until they were destroyed, but now a number have fled across the mountains. They came up a river and over the mountains and down the other side into the valley where the Wemissori begins, and there they met the Shoshoni.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Shoshoni?” said Sabinus.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page44" title="44"/>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay grinned tautly. “The Shoshoni are the enemies of my other people, the Blackfoot. And then these Mongols pursued the western peoples over the mountains and fought a battle with the Shoshoni, who broke and came to the Blackfoot. They brought one thing, and you will want to see that thing, I think. Send word to the Blackfoot who waits at our canoe, and he will bring it here to you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator pointed at one of his Praetorians. “Make all haste to the Mizipi bank and bring the Blackfoot who waits at the canoe.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And show him all due respect,” Marcellinus added.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Praetorian saluted and hurried from the room with a jangle of steel armor.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The Blackfoot unwrapped the bundle he had brought into the Imperial presence. Under the fabric was a long, slim tube of iron. Taianita frowned at it. “Is what?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay was watching their eyes. “You have seen this before.”</p>
<p class="para-p">As no one else seemed inclined to say anything, Marcellinus took the tube. He put his nose to the end and sniffed. “Yes, this is just like mine.”</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">“Yours?”</em> said Tahtay.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I did not make it. It is Mongol. I found it at the Market of the Mud.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What does it do, Wanageeska?” Taianita asked.</p>
<p class="para-p">“It shoots fire,” Sabinus said. He pointed to one end. “Here sits a package of Jin salt, a black powder somewhat like your liquid flame. When ignited, it sends fire through the tube, blazing hot, and so it is known as a fire lance.” He studied the tube professionally. “This one has a very smooth bore. Well engineered.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“The Mongols are coming,” Hadrianus said, eyes flashing. “And when they do, they will bring many of these.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita regarded him. “You are excited? War and death excite you?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes,” said the Imperator. “After all this time? Yes. After all the planning and journeying and endless logistics of legionary travel, war with a worthy foe is at hand. For my money, it cannot come soon enough.” He rubbed his hands together. “Well, then. Gentlemen, Taianita? I believe we must talk strategy.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page45" title="45"/>
<p class="para-p">“If so…” Tahtay took a deep breath and boldly met the Imperator’s eye. “If so, Caesar, we must know all you know of Mongols. And there must be no more tricks. No more lies. You must swear that now, to my eyes. You understand?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The room was silent. The Praetorians dropped their hands to their sword hilts as Tahtay approached the Imperator. Sabinus looked concerned.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus forced himself to breathe. This was a dangerous moment. One did not simply confront an Imperator and demand honesty.</p>
<p class="para-p">Yet of all who stood in the Praetorium, Hadrianus seemed the least perturbed. “Must I cut my flesh, Tahtay of Cahokia? Would you believe me then?” Without waiting for an answer, he gestured. The nearest Praetorian drew his pugio and handed it to his Imperator, hilt first. With no hesitation, the most powerful man in the world raised his left arm, allowing the sleeve to drop away and leave his skin bare.</p>
<p class="para-p">His eyes met Tahtay’s. “And then, will you be as free with the truth as I and do all in your power to bring the Hesperian tribes to fight alongside Roma against these demons? Will you ally with me against them? If so, I will willingly swear an oath in blood, and share my blade with you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay looked at Marcellinus, and a moment later so did Taianita.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus swallowed, his mouth suddenly dry. Now this had become his responsibility?</p>
<p class="para-p">But of course it had to be.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus was about as trustworthy as any Imperator. Blunt, ruthless, and perfectly capable of manipulating the situation to his advantage.</p>
<p class="para-p">And although Marcellinus liked and admired Tahtay, the war chief had lied to him just as much as Hadrianus had.</p>
<p class="para-p">But war with the Mongol Khan had made strange bedfellows in Asia and would do so here as well. Marcellinus no longer had any doubts where the true enemy lay in Nova Hesperia: it lay to their west, in Chinggis’s ruthless army. All the differences between Cahokia and Roma were as nothing compared with the atrocities committed by Chinggis and his men. They had left a trail of death, tens of millions of corpses, behind them in Asia. Such a thing must not be allowed to happen in Nova Hesperia.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page46" title="46"/>
<p class="para-p">From personal experience, Marcellinus also knew that an oath sworn in blood weighed upon a man’s soul like no other.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You should swear,” he said. “Tahtay, Caesar, both of you. In good faith and in blood. And I will swear to help you both.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I should not ask the other chiefs?” Tahtay asked Taianita in Cahokian.</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita looked again at Marcellinus and read his eyes. To Tahtay she said: “No, Fire Heart. The Wanageeska has spoken. We must do what is right, and we must do it now.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Nodding, Tahtay stepped forward and accepted the pugio from the Imperator.</p>
<p class="para-p">The blade cut deep. Roman and Cahokian blood flowed once more and mingled. </p></div></body></html>

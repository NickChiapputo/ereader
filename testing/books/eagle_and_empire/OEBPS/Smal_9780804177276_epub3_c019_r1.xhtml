<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">F</span>orward Camp was a complete mess: organized chaos in a dozen different languages.</p>
<p class="para-p">A few hundred miles to the west and north of Forward Camp the terrain creased up into bluffs and crags, gorges and canyons, but the landscape around the camp itself consisted of tallgrass prairies and gentle rolling hills with almost no trees: easy country to march or canter through with long sight lines from the hillcrests. In planning a war it was advisable to have as few topographical challenges as possible and be able to see your enemy approach from as far away as you could.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Braided River meandered in from the west, a hundred feet across at its widest point and considerably narrower in most other places, dotted with islands and mudflats but barely deep enough to be navigable by anything larger than a canoe. The Wemissori ran almost north-south here; it was much wider, four or five hundred feet across, and flowed with much more purpose. The Braided River dribbled into it as if with reluctance.</p>
<p class="para-p">Three years earlier, when Marcellinus had met the Hidatsa and ultimately found Tahtay living among the Blackfoot, he had been much farther up the Wemissori, through gorges and around a great curve until the river eventually had flowed out of the west. Such was the Braided River’s lack of drama that Marcellinus did not even recall seeing it join the Wemissori.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page302" title="302"/>
<p class="para-p">The Braided River was easy to bridge, and two wide Roman pontoon bridges now spanned it fifty feet apart. Crossing the bigger river was less straightforward and required boats, but in addition to the quinqueremes and drekars, the legions now had dozens of wide rafts available.</p>
<p class="para-p">In addition the Romans had chained both rivers, a technique Marcellinus had heard of in Europa and Asia but had never before seen. Heavy iron chains reached from one riverbank to another, supported by floating log booms. Such chain-and-boom systems formed an impenetrable obstacle to any craft that tried to pass upriver or down and would prevent Mongol vessels from passing by or Mongol fire ships from being driven downstream into the Roman pontoon bridges. The chain booms could be opened to allow quinqueremes to pass, but the unfortunate Hesperian traders who also used the river as a thoroughfare had no choice but to unload their boats, carry them around on land, and reload them on the other side of the massive chains.</p>
<p class="para-p">A substantial contingent of the 27th Legion—four cohorts—was camped on the eastern side of the Wemissori to defend its bank, guard the chain boom, and resist any flanking assault. The larger part of Forward Camp lay in the immense, mostly flat area between the two rivers, north of the Braided and west of the Wemissori. The square castra in the center of Forward Camp held the Third and the rest of the 27th. The broad sprawl that surrounded that nucleus held the Sixth Ferrata, the troopers of the cavalry alae and the cohortes equitatae, most of the three Cahokian cohorts, and many hundreds of horses. The plains upriver of Forward Camp on the west bank of the Wemissori hosted further hundreds of Cahokian and Iroqua warriors, and the land downriver of the convergence was home to what seemed like a thousand-thousand mules. Four-legs were constantly on the move; the grass around Forward Camp was already overgrazed and torn up, and keeping them fed required trips off into the Grass in all directions.</p>
<p class="para-p">Looming over this giant camp was the first of the six Wakinyan launch towers, 150 feet tall, the wood and steel scaffolding of its buttresses extending a similar length to the right and left to stabilize it. Marcellinus’s old joke notwithstanding, it really did look a little as if the Cahokians had brought their Master Mound with them in a crude and skeletal form. Two of the Wakinyan had been brought ashore and assembled inside a hastily built longhouse. The rest had been left safe aboard the <em class="char-i">Fides</em> to ensure that they would not get damaged in the confusion.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page303" title="303"/>
<p class="para-p">Alongside the Wakinyan launcher stood three Hawk launchers and three Eagle launchers, railed up and ready to go, their arrangement adding to the odd similarity of Forward Camp to the Great Plaza at Cahokia. Around them, lying like immense fallen beasts, were the unassembled pieces of the remaining towers.</p>
<p class="para-p">On the river side of the camp Pahin, Chogan, and the other Ravens had set up four steep wooden ramps to launch the Sky Lanterns. Today a single Lantern floated eight hundred feet above the camp, crewed with Cahokian and Roman lookouts. Here in the Grass, the army would keep a constant watch on the horizon.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator’s Praetorium tent was at the exact center of the castra, and Sabinus and Agrippa had quarters on either side of it. Marcellinus, always the contrarian, slept on hard ground in the outer camp with his mixed Cahokian and Roman forces. Tahtay and his Blackfoot, the Wolf Warriors under Wahchintonka, the People of the Hand, and the Tadodaho and his Iroqua were billeted in various areas in the outer camp. As Marcellinus had anticipated, the Cahokian summons to the Shappa Ta’atani had been rebuffed, and no warriors had come north in the springtime to join them. All the rumors they heard suggested that the Shappans had returned to their alliance with the Mongols.</p>
<p class="para-p">The central castra was as well organized as any Roman encampment, but in the outer area Marcellinus quickly became dependent on his adjutants and Unega’s Cherokee guides to find his way around. Forward Camp had been only lightly occupied during the winter months, and most of the troops and warriors inhabiting it now had been there only a couple of weeks or, in the Sixth’s case, four days. That meant that nobody knew where anything or anybody else was, and people spent much of their days either lost or falling over one another. Although even Enopay threw up his hands at the prospect of attempting an accurate count amid all this activity and confusion, it was conceivable that the Hesperians now formed the majority of the allied forces.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page304" title="304"/>
<p class="para-p">Despite the large number of nations clustered together in crowded conditions, there was little infighting among the allies. They were kept too busy by their generals and chiefs. Every day was a solid round of construction work, army drills, and exercises out in the Grass. But that might not last. A significant fraction of the League’s forces was still not convinced of the seriousness of the Mongol incursion. Hardly any of the Cahokians or Iroqua had seen the depredations of the Mongols with their own eyes. Because of the tales brought by his Blackfoot brothers, Tahtay believed in the threat completely, and most other Hesperians took the view that any enemy that worried the Romans, Blackfoot, and People of the Hand was worth taking seriously. However, a growing minority suspected the Mongol threat was either dramatically exaggerated or nonexistent. The outer area of Forward Camp was as volatile as Jin salt and might explode into violence at any moment.</p>
<p class="para-p">Just as he had right at the beginning of his Hesperian adventure, Marcellinus made it his duty to be anywhere and everywhere. He walked the camp by day and by night, sometimes with Tahtay, Enopay, Sintikala, or the Tadodaho of the Haudenosaunee, sometimes with Sabinus, Aelfric, Dizala, Gallus, or his quartermaster and adjutants, talking in quick Latin about logistics, supplies, injuries.</p>
<p class="para-p">Military action was rarely a clean and well-organized affair. Cohorts and alae, and the corresponding units of enemy infantry and cavalry, were not merely pieces on a game board. War on this scale was messy and contingent, and once the battles began, the generals would be lucky if they could even keep track of what was going on right in front of them in their own theaters. But with luck, at least they could prevent their armies from destroying themselves before they took the field.</p>
<p class="para-p">Slowly but surely, the great Mongol armies were approaching. On the basis of the intelligence brought by the Norse scouts and the Hesperian merchants, they had a month at most before the armies of the Khan came within range. And a month was not long at all where an army of this size was concerned.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page305" title="305"/>
<p class="para-sp">“We must dig channels,” Enopay said obstinately. “Canals for crap. Our soldiers spend too much time carrying merda around in reeking carts. And half the Iroqua won’t use the latrines anyway.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus increased his pace. If he could not leave his youngest adjutant behind, perhaps he could at least make the boy short of breath. “Juno, Enopay, I know all that.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay did a hop and skip to keep up. “How can you be a Roman and not believe in being clean? Is Roma a sewer? The men say no. Then why must Forward Camp be one?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had missed his chance to go on an early-morning mounted exercise with Hanska and the Third Cahokian because his quartermaster of the Sixth Ferrata had been haranguing him about corn shipments from Cahokia and his chief blacksmith had been complaining that the current batch of steel was too brittle to mend the wagon wheels that had bent on the journey here. Now he wanted to perform a surprise inspection of the Ninth Cohort’s tent area and see if there was any truth to Manius Ifer’s quiet reports of dealings in contraband tabaco among Caecina’s men, but Enopay was pursuing him through the streets ranting about shit. He stopped and turned on the boy. “This is an army camp. We’ll be here perhaps one more month, and then we’ll either be rotting here in the dirt ourselves or marching home to the Mizipi.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And in the meantime—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Look, Enopay, sewers don’t sluice themselves. We’d need running water. Pumps and pipes. A whole system. Or your channels of shit would just clog solid and we’d have a network of merda spanning the entire camp.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus strode on. The boy broke into a trot. “It can’t be that hard.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No, not once we’ve built the aqueduct,” Marcellinus said testily.</p>
<p class="para-p">“All right, but at least—”</p>
<p class="para-p">From the Sky Lantern far above them a horn sounded, and Marcellinus came to an abrupt halt, almost skidding in the mud.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page306" title="306"/>
<p class="para-p">“What?” Enopay looked around. The nearby legionaries also had stopped, suddenly alert.</p>
<p class="para-p">They were too far from the edge of the sprawling camp, and that edge was half a mile from the nearest hill. “Tower,” said Marcellinus, and ran toward the Wakinyan launch gantry. Jumping up, he started to climb the ladder.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Futete.” Below him, Enopay stood wide-eyed. “What? What’s happening?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Come on up, Enopay. I need your eyes.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Praetor reapplied himself to the climb, pulling himself up the ladder hand over hand. Enopay would follow or he wouldn’t, but Marcellinus couldn’t wait. He felt a new vibration through the tower and glanced back. Taianita and Manius Ifer had appeared and were coming, too, one on each side of the ladder, racing up after him, and yes, Enopay was gingerly pulling himself up and trying not to look down.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus stepped onto the platform just below the tower’s peak. A few feet above his head was the steel launching rail. Marcellinus glanced at it out of habit. It looked solid, ready to go if they needed it.</p>
<p class="para-p">He looked out over Forward Camp and the grasslands beyond. Behind him the Roman castra was orderly enough, on the standard grid pattern; in front of him the outer camp was a sprawling mass of humanity, its tents and lodges arrayed in halfhearted lanes that gave way to impromptu stabling areas. The horsemen of his Cohors IX Thracum Syriaca were half mounted and almost ready to go out into the Grass to forage. Beyond, a muddle of Hesperians walked around them, and mules dotted the low hills.</p>
<p class="para-p">From the height of a Sky Lantern Marcellinus could have seen farther, but even from here he saw enough: a line of maybe half a dozen horsemen on a hill in the middle distance. They were a couple of miles away, but even with Marcellinus’s fuzzy eyesight, at such a distance their appearance and demeanor set them apart from Roman or Hesperian riders. The shape of their armor, the odd glimpses of color, the additional horses that each rider led behind him; none were typical of Roma or its allies.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page307" title="307"/>
<p class="para-p">Taianita arrived by his side, breathing hard. “Five of them,” she said. “Each with three extra mounts.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Light cavalry. Scouts.” Manius Ifer paused on the ladder just below the platform to grab Enopay’s wrist and haul him up. The boy clambered painfully onto the platform in a crouched, crabbed posture more reminiscent of a man fifty years older, fear knotting his limbs. He seized the wooden rail in front of him. “Mongols?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No, fur merchants,” Taianita said sarcastically.</p>
<p class="para-p">Well, they were wearing furs; of that Marcellinus was sure.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Should we try to parley with them?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“They’re scouts, not envoys.” Manius Ifer now stood on Enopay’s far side. “Envoys would be advancing toward us with purpose. These are wary. Seeing where we are, and how many.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We should kill them or chase them off. Why do we not send out soldiers after them?” Taianita was breathing more heavily than the climb up the tower warranted. Marcellinus could hardly blame her. If not for Pezi’s bravery and sacrifice, Taianita might have spent the last year as a prisoner of the Mongols. No surprise that the mere sight of their scouts provoked a strong emotion in her.</p>
<p class="para-p">“We want them to know where we are,” Marcellinus said. “In a land this huge, opposing armies need scouts to bring them together. How else would we find each other to fight?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita shook her head, baffled, but Marcellinus was in no mood to explain any further. “Just these men? Do you see others, farther out?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“There.” Ifer was pointing toward the river. “And there. Less than ten in each group.” Marcellinus could see nothing but muddy water and green hills. How Ifer could pick out anything at that distance was a mystery to him.</p>
<p class="para-p">The five scouts on the nearby hill had halted. Obviously their facial expressions could not be seen at that distance, but their calm immobility seemed threatening. “They want us to know they’re watching.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We should be watching <em class="char-i">them</em>,” Taianita said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“And we are.” Marcellinus controlled his impatience with difficulty. “We have fifteen scouting parties along the rivers and in the Grass.” Dawn and dusk were the scouts’ hours to approach an enemy with the least risk of riding straight into foraging or exercising units. Even now, far from here, a small row of Roma’s Norse or Gallic scouts might be giving the encamped army of Chinggis Khan a similarly cold inspection. Other Roman scouts would be on their way back toward the legions after surveillance on previous days to provide updated information about the Mongol armies’ strengths and distances.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page308" title="308"/>
<p class="para-p">“I still think sending their heads back to the Khan would be a worthy message,” Enopay said. “They want to demoralize us? Let us kill every Mongol who walks away from their army. Let them be scared to step away from their fellows.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Such piecemeal harassment of enemy forces was the Hesperian way. Marcellinus knew that from bitter experience. He turned to Ifer. “Back in Asia, how far ahead of the main army did Mongol scouts typically patrol?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Anything from a hundred miles ahead to a thousand. Generally around two hundred. But here, who knows?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Could they be closer than we think? Making better time than our scouts are telling us? Even outpacing our scouts?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“With a baggage train it’ll be hard for them to do better than fifteen, twenty miles a day. Most of the tales of Mongol lightning strikes in Europa were based on misdirection or lies.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was unconvinced. “We need exercises in deployment, right away, with the whole army. Battle lines. Damn it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus had wanted such exercises to begin the previous week. His Praetors had demurred, Marcellinus included. The men were not prepared yet. The Hesperians especially needed much more training in their individual cohorts before coming together as an army.</p>
<p class="para-p">Well, the sands of time were draining away. They would just have to be ready now.</p>
<p class="para-p">The closest Mongol scouts began to move again, this time to the right. They would keep their distance but climb to the top of a different hill for another view of the encampment of the Imperium and the League.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page309" title="309"/>
<p class="para-p">Two more cornu blasts came, each with a distinct pattern, separated by a few seconds. Ifer nodded and moved to the ladder. The first signal had come from the Sky Lantern above them, broadcasting the information that the Mongol scout party was on the move. The second signal came from behind them in camp and was the call to senior officers. The Imperator was summoning his Praetors. The tribunes would also muster, ready to execute whatever orders came down from on high.</p>
<p class="para-p">The rank and file were preparing, too. Below Marcellinus men were marshaling, the laggards now out of their tents, centurions and decurions barking out orders to hurry their troops. Everyone knew today would be a day of action. Not a battle, but the next best thing.</p>
<p class="para-p">And drifting above it all, and if anything even more apparent at the height of the Wakinyan launch tower, came another strong waft of ordure.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay was not wrong. Forward Camp reeked.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">By moonlight, Marcellinus walked the streets of the inner castra with Decinius Sabinus and Lucius Agrippa, agreeing on details of men and assignments for the deployment exercise they planned for the morrow. Afterward he exited into the still tragically disorganized mess of the outer camp to meet with Tahtay, Akecheta, Mahkah, and Hanska about Hesperian support of the exercise. Returning at long last to his tent, he found Sintikala and Enopay discussing how to construct a makeshift Longhouse of the Wings closer to the launchers, and the most efficient way of transporting more Catanwakuwa from the quinqueremes to this longhouse. They needed to complete this as a matter of some urgency, as they were still unable to fly the Hawk patrols that would become essential as the enemy neared. However, as soon as Marcellinus appeared, Enopay strategically yawned and excused himself, at which point Sintikala challenged Marcellinus to a skirmish of a most energetic and pleasant nature that kept them engaged for some time. They fell asleep wrapped around each other, which complicated their abrupt awakening just a few hours later.</p>
<p class="para-p">In the dark before the dawn, the sky lit up, and there was an earsplitting bang that seemed to come from mere inches away. Marcellinus’s eyes snapped open.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page310" title="310"/>
<p class="para-p">Through the walls of the deerskin tent Marcellinus saw the remains of a bright flash. Almost at the same time came another explosion, the scatter of sparks, and a sharp smell that he recognized from his nightmares.</p>
<p class="para-p">Jin salt, the black powder of far eastern Asia, had come to Forward Camp. The Mongols were assaulting them with thunderclap bombs.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala awoke all at once and lashed out, thumping Marcellinus on the side of the head. They rolled, limbs entangled. “Shit!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Shoving him away, Sintikala leaped up and lunged for the doorskin of the tent. Marcellinus was on his feet just moments later. A deep fear gripped him. Even after all this time the images of the Night of Knives, the treacherous Iroqua night assault on Cahokia, were still vivid in his memory. Sintikala’s accidental clipping of his ear brought a pulse of pain reminiscent of the head injury he had sustained later that day. And over and above it all was his terror-filled realization that the Mongols were <em class="char-i">here</em> attacking Forward Camp when they should have still been at least two hundred miles away…</p>
<p class="para-p">And, not least, his fear for Sintikala, who had just run naked out of the tent they shared into what might already be a battlefield.</p>
<p class="para-p">He burst out of the tent and looked up into a sky where it seemed that the stars were exploding, yet he saw no enemies in the streets, only befuddled legionaries stirring themselves. The explosions still rang in his ears, along with the babble of confused voices in many languages, but he heard no screams of pain or torment.</p>
<p class="para-p">Another dazzling light flashed above him. He instinctively flinched away—might such a glare blind him?—but soon glanced back to see a blob of red, white, and purple light falling slowly through the air. To illuminate the camp so that the attackers could pick out targets?</p>
<p class="para-p">Forward Camp could not withstand a siege. That was not its purpose. Its fence of wattle and daub was mostly to keep the horses in and the mules out. A ditch six feet deep surrounded that fence, and the prairie sod and earth thus excavated formed a low wall around the camp, but they had no palisade. If the Mongols attacked in force, their defenses would provide little protection.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page311" title="311"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus ducked back into his tent. He grabbed breechcloth and tunic, greaves and breastplate, and dressed for war as best he could.</p>
<p class="para-p">Another, much larger explosion came. Now he heard screaming, and it was only about a hundred yards away.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s head pounded. He needed to protect it or his confidence would be gone, sapped by his fear of a disabling injury. He grabbed his Praetor’s helmet, despite the white plume that would glow in the rocket’s glare and make him a target, and shoved it onto his head. He snatched a gladius, and finally he was ready for whatever the night might bring. Out he went again.</p>
<p class="para-p">The support struts for the Wakinyan launcher were aflame, the wood blazing merrily. As he watched, a second thunderclap bomb came in, lobbed by an unseen engine outside the camp, and exploded in a sudden bright sun just a few tens of feet away from the main tower of the launcher. Marcellinus registered fleeting impressions of a myriad of small flying objects radiating from the explosion in a sharp cloud and then the screams of agony from the men who were trying to fight the fire.</p>
<p class="para-p">Two Roman trumpets sounded at once. Then one mercifully fell silent, allowing him to decode the message of the other.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus broke into a run, calling for Mahkah, then changed his mind and his direction, swerving right. “Hanska! Third Cahokian! Up and to horse!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Mahkah was prudent where his horse was concerned. He loved the fine four-legs, and his guilt at being responsible for the crippling of one might slow him down at this critical time. Hanska, though, viewed horses with little sentiment and was crazy enough for anything. And indeed she was up already, she and a good two dozen of her warriors, only half of them wearing even a tunic, let alone armor, but all on their feet and rushing to their mounts as the skies erupted around them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus ran up to her, panting. “Blinkers!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m not fucking stupid,” Hanska snapped, and indeed she had already strapped the leather cups to her horse’s head, the tack that attached to the cheek plates and prevented a horse from seeing to the rear or the side, allowing it to look only directly ahead. “Who do we kill?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page312" title="312"/>
<p class="para-p">“They must have a trebuchet throwing thunderclap bombs, with Jin rockets to light their way.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska stamped her foot. “Yes, of course…Gaius, how <em class="char-i">many</em> of <em class="char-i">what</em>?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I don’t know. Maybe Mongol light cavalry?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Very fucking useful.” Hanska leaped onto her horse. “Third! Come on!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s warhorse was in a stall deep in the castra. Even if he’d had time, he didn’t know where to find it. A trooper of his First Cohort always brought it to him when he needed it. “Futete,” he said.</p>
<p class="para-p">He saw no saddled horse that did not already have a Cahokian astride it. He did, however, hear the chink of Roman armor and see three ragged centuries of the Sixth jogging toward the Westgate. They clearly had donned their armor in a hurry, but at least they were carrying scuta and pila.</p>
<p class="para-p">That would have to do. He was almost relieved. Damned if he felt confident enough to ride an unfamiliar horse by night anyway. Horses had better night vision than people but were also more likely to spook in the dark. They sometimes could not tell shadows from holes and might shy or bolt without warning. He was better off on foot.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus ran to his infantry. He did not recognize the centurion leading the squad, just another short-haired, muscular soldier with clear skin. Without tattoos, Marcellinus now found Romans difficult to tell apart. The centurion recognized him, though, or at least his Praetor’s plume, and snapped him a salute. Marcellinus fell in alongside the centurion at a steady jog as another batch of the Sixth ran to join them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Where the hell was Sintikala? As if in answer, he heard the creaking twang of the launch equipment behind him as a Catanwakuwa shot over his head. He glimpsed it only for an instant before it was gone into the night. Briefly Marcellinus hoped she had found something to wear, and then there was no time for any further distracting thoughts because the Westgate was in front of them, and they were about to charge out of the camp and into gods knew what…</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page313" title="313"/>
<p class="para-p">Yet another rocket exploded in the sky, just in time for its light to alert Marcellinus to a hole in front of him. He hopped over it and kept running, through the open gate and out into the night.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The gate was not wide enough for infantry and cavalry to exit side by side. Hanska’s Third held up and waited for the four centuries of the Ironclads to jog on through, and then rode out to flank them.</p>
<p class="para-p">The lead centurion raised his hand, a dark shadow in the night. “Walk. Close up,” he commanded, and his soldiers slowed. Marcellinus came to a walk, too. It was a wise order. If they were about to fight, by all means let the soldiers get their breath back. If they continued to jog into the darkness, all it would take was for one man to trip over an unseen tussock and ten others would tumble over him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Peering ahead, Marcellinus saw only the shadows of the low hills. The glare of the rockets had unsettled his night vision. The legionaries beside him were just dark ghosts that smelled of leather, steel, and fear.</p>
<p class="para-p">They continued to advance. Behind them in the camp they could hear orders being shouted and the jangle and chink of armor as men hurried to obey them. That noise might well be covering up any quieter sounds of an ambush ahead. If there were Mongol cavalry nearby, the Romans would be able to see their silhouettes against the sky, but warriors might be squatting stealthily in the darkness all around them and not be noticed.</p>
<p class="para-p">“ ’Ware fire lances,” Marcellinus said quietly to the centurion.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Aye,” said the man, and raised his voice to spread the warning. “Beware skulking Mongols with fire lances!”</p>
<p class="para-p">As he said the words, the night lit up once again, right in front of them. Marcellinus heard not the crack of black powder but the <em class="char-i">whomph</em> of something large catching fire. He dropped forward instinctively. The legionaries around him reacted, too, each man grounding the heel of his scutum and taking a knee behind it. Marcellinus, who carried no shield, held up his left arm in front of his face in a futile attempt to block out that insanely bright light. He drew his right hand back, ready to swing his gladius, ready for a Mongol warrior to appear before him at any moment…</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page314" title="314"/>
<p class="para-p">Now he recognized the bright shape outlined in fire. Behind the low rise ahead of them a Mongol trebuchet was ablaze, the wooden frame and ropes all burning and distinct. Scores of men milled around the base of the trebuchet. Had that been an accident, or had the Mongols set fire to the thing themselves?</p>
<p class="para-p">The horses of Hanska’s Third Cahokian whinnied in fear, and some bucked. Above the crackle of the fire and the barked commands in Latin came the sound of Cahokian curses. Once again the night had turned to pandemonium. Marcellinus swore, too. Had they been crazy to leave the confines of the camp?</p>
<p class="para-p">“Up, in close order!” cried the centurion, and the men of the Sixth rose to their feet, shields raised and overlapping. “Forward, on the double!” and they jogged after him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus stayed where he was. The enemy warriors he saw guarding the trebuchet’s base were holding spears and clubs but seemed dazed and uncertain. Some were already down on the ground. Perhaps injured or incapacitated?</p>
<p class="para-p">A cloud of thick smoke blew across him. Marcellinus coughed. Was this a trap? Yet behind his four centuries of the Sixth he could hear more legionaries pounding up, racing out of the camp and spreading right and left in support; there seemed little chance that Mongol reinforcements could overwhelm them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now came the clangor of steel weapons as battle was joined. The legionaries had arrived at the base of the merrily blazing siege engine and set upon its guards. Men shrieked in agony as they were cut down.</p>
<p class="para-p">More legionaries ran past Marcellinus with swords and spears raised, eager to engage the foe. Yet again, Marcellinus’s instincts were rebelling. Where were the Mongols’ horses? It did not feel right.</p>
<p class="para-p">This was the trouble with night actions. This was why the Roman military tried to avoid them whenever possible. Too confusing, too much chance of chaos.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page315" title="315"/>
<p class="para-p">Over the commotion of the butchery he heard a whistling sound, followed by an earsplitting explosion not fifty feet away. Against the bright afterimage of its flash Marcellinus saw bodies hurled into the air, and the roaring and screaming redoubled. The gladius had slipped from his hand in the shock, and as he futilely held up his arms to try to ward off whatever was happening, bright shards of pain erupted in the palms of his hand and along his forearms. At the same time pottery plinked off his shoulder greaves and helmet. “Holy fucking Jove…”</p>
<p class="para-p">Another thunderclap bomb. Parchment or thin deerskin wrapped around a lethal combination of black powder and sharp potsherds. If the explosion didn’t get his soldiers, the shrapnel would. “Damn it—”</p>
<p class="para-p">A horse appeared from nowhere beside him. Marcellinus dropped to the ground and rolled, hoping that it wouldn’t trample him, that the Mongol astride it was not armed with one of those deadly hooked spears he had seen at Yupkoyvi or, worse, a fire lance…</p>
<p class="para-p">“Get up!” Hanska shouted. “Gaius, they’re killing the prisoners!”</p>
<p class="para-p">He found his gladius, jumped to his feet, looked up at her. “What? More bombs?”</p>
<p class="para-p">She reached down a strong arm, grabbed his forearm. “Just one, from the other trebuchet. The Mongols are retreating. Roma is killing <em class="char-i">us</em> instead!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus kicked upward futilely. Hanska hauled on his arm. Her horse sidestepped, whinnying in protest, but somehow Marcellinus clambered up onto the horse’s rump behind her. Her words still made no sense to him. Other trebuchet? Prisoners? “What the hell?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hold on.” Hanska spurred her horse, cantering straight toward the Roman legionaries and the men on foot they were hacking to the ground in the baleful light from the burning trebuchet. Marcellinus hurriedly flung his arms around her to avoid being thrown off.</p>
<p class="para-p">Over her shoulder he saw several dozen mounted Mongol warriors a few hundred yards away, galloping across the plains away from a skeletal shadow that had to be a second trebuchet.</p>
<p class="para-p">And right in front of him, a massacre. Everything became clear in an instant.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page316" title="316"/>
<p class="para-p">“Stand down!” Marcellinus bellowed at the top of his voice. “Sixth Ironclads, stand down, fall back!”</p>
<p class="para-p">As Hanska’s horse loomed over the Romans, they turned and raised their swords against her. In the light of the flickering flames he saw panic in their eyes, the daze of combat. In their bloodlust, they might easily take Hanska and Marcellinus for Mongol barbarians and cut them down as readily as they were killing the others. “Stop!” he shouted again. “Soldiers, stand down! For the love of all the gods, stop killing!”</p></div></body></html>

<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">B</span>y the time they cleared the deck of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> the air around the ships was rank with smoke. Marcellinus had never been on a battlefield so obscured, and wished the wind would pick up and blow it clear.</p>
<p class="para-p">Toward the end he had become separated from Hanska. She had leaped into one of the Mongol junks to help the Romans slaughter the surviving Mongols and Jin. Marcellinus had run forward to take control of the Second Century of the Fourth Cohort, who were defending the ship’s onager upon the death of their centurion. Caecina, who had formerly been standing there, had vanished completely. Now Marcellinus looked around him and realized that for the moment, the battle here was won.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Wait!” He ran back to Titus Otho, who was still commanding from the poop deck. “Don’t cut the junks loose until we commandeer their black powder or any bombs they may have aboard them.”</p>
<p class="para-p">About to curse him again, the ship’s master now thought better of it. He swung to give the order, while at the same time shouting to the hortator to get the oarsmen benched and ready to row again as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="para-p">Men leaped aboard the junks. Legionaries…and a Cahokian boy. “Enopay!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Not every Mongol aboard the ship was dead; many were wounded, dazed, still moving. Enopay did not respond but disappeared down a stairway into the sinking rear of the vessel.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page210" title="210"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus ran, jumped up, and leaped across to the Mongol ship, his momentum almost carrying him head over heels. Legionaries came up empty-handed from beneath the foredeck, with other men grabbing Mongol weapons or spitefully stabbing their downed foes. Enopay reappeared, staggering up the rear stairway out of the sinking stern of the junk under the weight of a round metal ball. “Thunder crash bomb.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Juno, Enopay…”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I may not fight well, but I can carry. Help me get this onto the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>.”</p>
<p class="para-p">They clambered back aboard the quinquereme and cut the junk free. Hanska and the Chitimachan were helping the legionaries throw Mongol corpses off the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>’s deck into the river. Enopay stowed the thunder crash bomb amidships. Marcellinus ran back to stand beside Titus Otho, peering forward through the smoke. “What of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> and <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em>?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Braced together in the thick of it,” Titus Otho said. “We go to them now.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Where’s the <em class="char-i">Fides</em>?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“With us.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus scanned the deck. “And where the hell is Vibius Caecina?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“The most useless tribune in the Ironclads? Dead, we can only hope.” For the first time, the ship’s master grinned at him.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was a ridiculous breach of discipline, but Marcellinus didn’t care. “Let’s get this ship to where the real battle is.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yeah.” Otho peered through the smoke. “Fuck all this housekeeping and deck swabbing. I’m already bored.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Tell me about the other tribunes. If Verus has his hands full, who’s next in command? Who’s worth the candle?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Otho grinned again. “Figuring out who you need to assassinate to take command?”</p>
<p class="para-p">This was a little close to the bone. Otho’s flippant irreverence was proving trying. Marcellinus bit his tongue. “Hardly.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page211" title="211"/>
<p class="para-p">“Well, remember me for some advancement when you do.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Just tell me, Otho. And which ships they’re on.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Verus himself commands the First Cohort. His First Tribune is Aurelius Dizala.” Titus Otho nodded. “That one, Dizala, he’s all right. If you could get him on your side, you’d be golden. Pun intended. But you won’t. He’s Verus’s man through and through. So he commands the Second and Third Cohorts, and he’ll be on the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em>. Cohorts Four and Five are on the <em class="char-i">Minerva</em>, under Statius Paulinus. He’s competent enough but young. Overwhelms easily once the spears fly. Probably taking orders from his own centurions by now. Flavius Urbicus, Sixth and Seventh Cohorts, is on the <em class="char-i">Clementia</em>. Good man. You already know about Caecina, who you’ll find anywhere except actually commanding the Eighth and Ninth. And Ifer over there on the <em class="char-i">Fides</em> is keeping the Tenth straight for the time being, and hopefully forever, since he actually has a brain in his head.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Dizala, Paulinus, Urbicus. Caecina. Ifer.” Marcellinus looked from one quinquereme to the next, settling the names in his mind.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I wouldn’t try too hard,” said the ship’s master. “Half of ’em will be in Elysium by sunset.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">A few moments later they came out of the smoke and took stock of their next riverine battleground.</p>
<p class="para-p">The dozen battle junks that swarmed around the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> were better armored than those that had attacked the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>. One was larger than the rest, its wide curving prow decorated with a tiger’s face. It also flew a complicated standard on its mast. This must be Subodei Badahur’s flagship, within his own personal squadron.</p>
<p class="para-p">They were trying a more innovative approach than Marcellinus had seen so far. Better able to resist bombardment from the decks and battle towers of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>, these junks were using their striking arms as delivery devices for thunder crash bombs. A Mongol sailor in the rigging would load one of the large metal bombs onto the end of the striking arm and set the fuse. He would light the fuse and drop the arm when the battle junk was at its closest approach to the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>, carrying the deadly black powder bomb straight down to the quinquereme’s deck.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page212" title="212"/>
<p class="para-p">It was a bold tactic that was having mixed success. Three junks already lay dead in the water, having been blasted by their own bombs or otherwise immobilized by the Romans, but the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> had two broad and smoking holes side by side at its port bow and was listing and taking on water. To starboard it had been joined by the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em>, and the two ships were braced together stem to stern by harpax cable, their hulls moored together to make a single fighting platform. The <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> was taking heavy fire on its own flank, though its onager and scorpios were currently keeping the Mongols at bay. More soldiers were spilling up from belowdecks on both ships, presumably the oarsmen.</p>
<p class="para-p">The <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> was still several hundred feet away when two junks under full sail changed course to make a concerted and apparently suicidal run at her. With the wind directly behind them, their attackers approached at an almost uncanny rate.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Trying to strip our oars,” Titus Otho said tersely. “Helmsman! To port!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Agonizingly slowly the quinquereme yawed to port in an attempt to ram one of the attack junks, but the sailing ships were much more nimble. The leftward junk arrived first, sliding along the hull of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> closely enough to slam into its leading oars and smash them to matchwood. At the same time, a Mongol sailor slung one of the lighter thunderclap bombs onto the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>’s top deck, where it duly exploded. The nearer Romans and Cherokee had hurled themselves aside even before the junk arrived; those farther away did their best to protect themselves behind their round naval shields. The enemy sailor who had thrown the bomb now flew backward straight off the top deck of his own ship to splash into the river behind, already dead with a Roman scorpio bolt clean through his chest.</p>
<p class="para-p">Two dozen oars had broken by the time the junk’s momentum failed it. The ship then faced a barrage of Roman missiles and erupted in a mass of splinters and chunks of wood. Warriors jumped overboard.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was already running for the bow, but the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>’s crew was well trained; injured legionaries were being pulled away from the burning hole the Mongol bomb had carved in the top deck while other men flung water from the barrels on deck to quench the burning. Unlike Cahokian liquid flame, it appeared that the incendiary black powder of the Jin and Mongols could be neutralized by water.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page213" title="213"/>
<p class="para-p">As Marcellinus passed it, the great ballista on the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>’s deck fired and sent a huge bolt into the stern of the Mongol vessel that menaced them on the starboard side. The ballista bolt practically split the helmsman of the junk in two, and the tiller behind him exploded in a flurry of shards and splinters of wood. Although Marcellinus had not heard the command, at the same time the starboard oarsmen had backwatered, guiding the now helmless enemy vessel into the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>’s hull.</p>
<p class="para-p">The legionary manning the harpax ballista had not been idle, and as he pulled the other attacking Mongol vessel toward the <em class="char-i">Providentia,</em> the Roman corvus fell, locking it into place. A good half century of the Sixth Ferrata was already in position and now began to board the Mongol ship. Marcellinus swerved in midrun and joined them. As he leaped from the bulwark of the quinquereme, the brown river flashed beneath him, providing him with the sudden realization that if he went overboard, his armor would carry him down to the mud at the river bottom in moments. Then his boots landed on the deck of the Mongol ship and he was driving a Roman hasta spear through the chest of a Mongol warrior and swinging his gladius, and all rational thought left his mind once more in the flurry of combat.</p>
<p class="para-p">They made short work of the remaining Mongols, but this time there was no chance to search the junk for black powder. Marcellinus barely made it back up onto the deck of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> before the Romans cut the wrecked junk loose with its cargo of corpses.</p>
<p class="para-p">Breathing heavily, Marcellinus threaded his way to the bow of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> and took stock.</p>
<p class="para-p">The <em class="char-i">Fides</em> was still beside them, having fought off its own attackers. The hospital ship <em class="char-i">Clementia</em> had gotten off lightly and was gamely following them. A pitched war of attrition was going on to the east between the Roman archers on the flotilla of assembled drekars and triremes and a mixed force of bowmen of the Yokot’an Maya and Shappa Ta’atani on the other, but that would have to wait. If the two largest galleys of the Roman fleet went down with all hands, the battle was lost. The <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> had to get to the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> and the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em>.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page214" title="214"/>
<p class="para-p">Increasingly, their river battle was beginning to look like a land war. The <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> and <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> were locked together, a floating island under attack from at least a dozen Mongol ships, many Tlingit canoes, and two longboats of the Yokot’an Maya. In short, the Roman forces were besieged within a field fortification of floating wood, and it was up to the forces at Marcellinus’s disposal to raise the siege.</p>
<p class="para-p">And by that point, Marcellinus had little doubt that it was up to him. Vibius Caecina had reappeared but was sitting by the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>’s onager with his hand over his mouth, giving no orders. Marcellinus briefly considered going to talk to the tribune, then discarded the idea. At no point in the battle had Caecina approached Titus Otho to give him a command or offer intelligence. Neither had he fought with the Roman vexillations that had resisted the Mongol junks. For a while he had stood with the centurion of the launch team, attempting to look useful, but his demeanor spoke “civilian” to Marcellinus. As often happened in the lesser legions, it was the noncommissioned officers, centurions and others of similar rank such as the ships’ masters, who were directing this battle.</p>
<p class="para-p">Well. As it now seemed that Otho was willing to work with Marcellinus, so much the better.</p>
<p class="para-p">He glanced across at the <em class="char-i">Fides</em> just in time to catch the eye of Manius Ifer. Ifer pointed to port of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> and then to starboard of the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> and made broad gestures in hand-talk. <em class="char-i">Query: dock each side?</em></p>
<p class="para-p">As the Romans’ expert in covert expeditions, Ifer had spent more time than most in the field with Hesperians. Naturally he would know the hand-talk by now. Marcellinus cast his gaze again over the beleaguered Roman vessels ahead of them and the positions of their Mongol assailants and made a series of broad gestures back. Ifer raised his eyebrows in surprise but nodded quickly and turned to talk to the master of the <em class="char-i">Fides</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus made his way back to Titus Otho on the poop deck of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>. “Swing around to port and raise the rowing tempo. We’re going to smack Subodei Badahur right between the eyes.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page215" title="215"/>
<p class="para-p">Titus Otho nodded. “About bloody time. <em class="char-i">Long</em> past bloody time. How do you boys want to proceed?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Boys?” Himself and Ifer? No matter. “Titus Otho, I have an idea in mind that you might not like.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh?” The ship’s master raised his eyebrows. “Try me. I like a challenge.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> went in first at slow ramming speed, hitting the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> amidships at a forty-five-degree angle. With its hull weakened by the repeated assaults from the thunder crash bombs, the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>’s ram cleaved straight through the side of the Roman flagship with a grating cacophony of steel against wood.</p>
<p class="para-p">Naturally enough, Badahur must have assumed his own flagship would be the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>’s target and had backwatered to bring its bow around to face the Roman quinquereme. Caught unaware, this junk became the focus of a hail of ballista fire and arrows from the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> and beat a hasty retreat. Her oarsmen had to put in a heroic effort to overcome the current.</p>
<p class="para-p">As for the Mongol forces on the deck of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>, they could scarcely believe their eyes. The remains of the First Cohort under Calidius Verus’s command was bottled up at the ship’s stern, arrayed in a rough defensive formation between the growing Mongol force and the poop deck. The artillerymen with their scorpios had fallen back to line the bulwark at the front edge of this deck. The spectacular arrival of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> had forced Badahur’s flagship junk and two other junks back from pulling alongside the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> and assailing the First Cohort from two sides. Now the tables were turned, with the Mongol forces divided and under attack from the First on the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> and the Ninth Cohort on the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">The <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>’s corvus fell into an open area of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>’s deck, but it was largely superfluous; the ships were locked fast together, and Marcellinus’s legionaries were already rushing aboard over the port and starboard gunwales at the ship’s prow. At the same time the <em class="char-i">Fides</em> arrived on the far side of the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> and moored to it in more conventional style with harpax bolts to stem and stern, delivering a further five hundred men directly to the heart of the battle.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page216" title="216"/>
<p class="para-p">“Keep them off,” Marcellinus said to the artillerymen at the scorpios, then ran forward to give the same message to the centurion in charge of the onager crew. “Keep the ships of Badahur away. That’s your one job. Hold them at bay. Nobody boards us again. Understood?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sir, yes, sir,” said the centurion. Vibius Caecina gaped at him. Marcellinus nodded curtly, resisting his urge to stab the man, and kept moving.</p>
<p class="para-p">He had lost sight of Hanska, Taianita, and Enopay, but the mopping-up operation on the stern deck of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> was going well. Two quinquereme decks away, the legionaries of the <em class="char-i">Fides</em> were in ruthless hand-to-hand with Mongol warriors, and Marcellinus was sure they would prevail; more Romans were joining the battle all the time from belowdecks on the <em class="char-i">Fides</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">Perhaps it was time to save lives rather than destroy them. He ran up to a centurion, by his insignia the fourth centurion of the Ninth Cohort. “Rescue party. Belowdecks on the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>. Let’s leave no one behind. Yes?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The man nodded tersely and gave the orders. He and Marcellinus jumped aboard the deck of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> at the head of a force of some sixty legionaries.</p>
<p class="para-p">The <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> was listing badly to port, but the support of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> was preventing it from rolling any farther. The foredecks of Verus’s flagship were now mostly clear, mainly as a result of the firing of ballista and scorpio bolts right over the heads of Marcellinus and the Fourth Century to keep Badahur’s junks at bay. Now those junks changed course, rowing around the bow of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> to lend support to the increasingly beleaguered Mongol force aboard the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> next door.</p>
<p class="para-p">As Marcellinus took a deep breath and prepared to run down the steps into the lower decks of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>, Enopay appeared beside him, panting, the gladius in his hand wavering with the effort of holding it. “Enopay! Damn it, go back!”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page217" title="217"/>
<p class="para-p">Enopay glanced around and gasped, “More dangerous…back there than…with you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Then stay close.” Marcellinus pounded down the steps behind the centurion.</p>
<p class="para-p">Ramming the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> had been a calculated risk. After all this time in battle the oarsmen from below <em class="char-i">should</em> have left the rowing decks. The <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> itself was so badly damaged, the holes in its sides so gaping, that it would never be navigable again. As a wooden vessel it would not quite sink but would eventually lie awash, completely bilged and incapable of salvage. If anything, the buoyancies of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> and <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> were now holding the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> up and preventing it from slumping even deeper into the Mizipi. But if there were men still belowdecks, perhaps injured men whom Verus had chosen to keep out of the battle, Marcellinus did not want them on his conscience.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was even more cramped on the rowing decks than Marcellinus had thought possible. On the third and highest of the decks there was almost no headroom; the oarsmen must have had a backbreaking shuffle to get to and from their rowing stations. At this level there were two men per oar on either side, and many of the oars were still lying higgledy-piggledy across the thwarts and making their passage difficult. The lighting was dim, the louvers not having been opened again after the gas assault, and Marcellinus saw nothing. “Enopay, for Juno’s sake, don’t run ahead.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“But I know where I’m going,” Enopay said, and disappeared.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus banged his head, swore, ran forward, and looked down. Enopay had darted down through a hatchway, taking broad steps down to the deck below. Behind Marcellinus the men of the Fourth were spreading out, searching, many of them now running down other stairwells.</p>
<p class="para-p">The second deck was much like the third: cramped, airless, empty of oarsmen. Here the floors were awash in several inches of water, with more flowing in, and with a chill Marcellinus realized that he was standing below the level of the Mizipi outside the ship. “Damn it. Enopay, there’s nobody here.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page218" title="218"/>
<p class="para-p">“Come on. If there’s anyone, they’ll be where the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> came through.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“First deck is underwater,” said a laconic voice from behind them. “Anyone down there is done.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Anyone still down there was an idiot,” Enopay said. “Eyanosa, come.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The cramped space and the water underfoot were increasingly oppressive, the light level even lower, and Marcellinus banged his head on something hard that jutted out of the hull in front of him. “Shit.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Watch out for the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>,” Enopay said at the same moment.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sure enough, Marcellinus’s probing hand in front of him had just slapped the wet outer hull of the warship he had ridden in on.</p>
<p class="para-p">“We can get around it,” Enopay said, and disappeared again.</p>
<p class="para-p">From sixty feet away beneath the hatchway where they had entered the second deck, the centurion called. “No one. We’re out of here. Come on, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Get clear,” Marcellinus said. “We’re going aft.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He splashed through water, following Enopay. They were now in the rear of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>, and he became aware of an increasing rumbling sound and an ominous creaking. The rumbling was the noise of men running and fighting two decks up. He preferred not to speculate about the creaking.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Man down,” Enopay said. “Help me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Alive? Roman?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sailor. Breathing. Unconscious.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay pulled ineffectually at the man. Marcellinus helped him. In the dim light he at first thought that the sailor was holding a club in his hand, but once he seized it, he realized it was a bottle.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus threw it away from them. It broke against the inside of the hull, filling the air around them with the sickly smell of wine. “Damn Verus.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page219" title="219"/>
<p class="para-p">“Nothing. Let’s get this man out.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay heaved and Marcellinus shoved, and they got the sailor up into the third deck. “One more.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Can’t.” Enopay was panting. “Too heavy.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus leaned down and sniffed the sailor’s lips. There was no hint of wine on his breath, and anyway, he did not look the type: well groomed and attired, wet only from the flooding river water he had been slumped in when they had found him.</p>
<p class="para-p">“He is not drunk,” Marcellinus said. “You agree?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What, Eyanosa? Wait, he’s awake.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hardly that, but the man was stirring. He raised a shaky hand to his head, opened his eyes, and tried to focus.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus knew what a strong blow to the head could be like. “We’re friends,” he said gently. “But the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> is finished. You have to come with us. Hurry.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">As they emerged on the poop deck of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>, behind Roman lines, the ship creaked again and rolled to the left, putting the deck at an even greater angle. Marcellinus had never been so happy to get out of a confined space.</p>
<p class="para-p">Leaving the stunned sailor with Enopay, Marcellinus pushed past the guards on the steps and ran up to Calidius Verus’s side. The Praetor goggled at him. “Where the hell did you come from?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Belowdecks,” Marcellinus said tersely. “I rescued the man you sent to fetch your wine.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Verus eyed his expression and turned his face back to the battle before them. “I believe we have more important matters to attend to.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We do indeed.” Marcellinus stalked forward, still breathing deeply, and looked between the scorpio men at the scene beyond.</p>
<p class="para-p">The cohorts of the Sixth Ironclads were conducting a textbook military operation on the joined decks of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> and <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em>. Uneven terrain, to be sure, but the ranked soldiers were in a triple formation, three grouped lines with shields guarding the first rank, bowmen behind, and men armed with a mix of hasta and pila. On both ships they were advancing in lockstep despite the bulwark and the slight gap between the decks that separated them. The Mongol line was being irrevocably pushed back. Unfortunately for the enemy, behind them were the legionaries from the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>. The Mongols faced a battle on two fronts, fighting unhorsed.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page220" title="220"/>
<p class="para-p">Calidius Verus was hurrying forward into the thick of the action now, flanked by his adjutants and a century of his First Cohort, keen to take personal charge of the remaining effort. Good enough. Perhaps the outcome here was not in doubt. Off to the side of them Manius Ifer’s men from the <em class="char-i">Fides</em> were fighting on the decks of the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em>. Ifer himself was leading his men, his tribune’s helmet clearly visible at the front right edge of his troops. This was one of the most dangerous areas of a Roman formation; centurions customarily took that position, and the death toll among them was high. Marcellinus hoped Ifer would survive the day.</p>
<p class="para-p">Looking farther afield, he realized that the ships of Subodei Badahur had broken off their attack on the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>’s flank under heavy assault from the Roman artillery and had hoisted sail. He could even see Badahur himself waving his arms to give orders, the bandage distinctive across his face.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s first thought, that the Khan’s best general was fleeing the battlefield, was soon disproved. Badahur aimed to cut off the <em class="char-i">Minerva</em> and prevent it from going to the aid of the Romans, Norse, and Hesperians aboard the tangled mess of dragon ships and knarrs, Tlingit and Shappan canoes, and Maya longships that were doing battle. Even now, that whole combat area was being carried downriver on the Mizipi current, away from the larger war being fought on the decks of the four linked quinqueremes.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Gaius!” Taianita sprinted toward him, gladius in hand, and Marcellinus gasped. Her tunic was doused with blood and what looked like entrails. Blood gushed from her mouth and was smeared all across her face and down her bare legs.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Merda. Taianita, are you hurt?”</p>
<p class="para-p">She spit. “Lost some teeth. Killed some Mongols.” She grinned at him hideously, and he realized that she was not quite sane, not quite the Taianita he knew anymore. “Where is Son of the Sun? Where the fuck is he?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page221" title="221"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus pointed at the drekar battle. “Perhaps over there.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Let’s go. Let’s get the verpa. Where’s Hanska? Shit, come <em class="char-i">on</em>.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Taianita—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Futete!” Taianita ran from him to the edge of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>’s deck and measured the distance.</p>
<p class="para-p">With horror he realized that in her battle madness Taianita was considering swimming across to the battle for the longships. With a few steps he arrived back at her side and grabbed her arm. Glancing back quickly, he saw that Manius Ifer’s men had broken the Mongol column. The invaders were in rout, and shortly the Romans and allies would be victorious on the flagship.</p>
<p class="para-p">The <em class="char-i">Minerva</em> and <em class="char-i">Clementia</em>, caught in a stronger part of the Mizipi current during their long fight, also had won their battles. Their oars were beginning to move, but it would be a while longer before they could rejoin the rest of the galleys. They had been carried back so far that they were almost back in range of the Jin trebuchets, and Badahur’s ships would reach them first. “Damn it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Neither the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> nor the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> would ever be riverworthy again. Their damage was too great. Marcellinus had to get everyone off the stricken ships and then cut the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> free.</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita was trying to pull away from him. Now she punched him on the shoulder. “Juno, Taianita, wait just—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Use your eyes, verpa,” she snapped. “They’ve won. The bastard Shappans have the longships!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Shit…”</p>
<p class="para-p">It was true. Some of the warriors of Shappa Ta’atan were manning the oars of the two drekars while others threw Roman corpses overboard in full armor, where they disappeared quickly into the murky river. Alongside the dragon ships, warriors of the Yokot’an Maya and the Tlingit were returning to their own longboats and canoes.</p>
<p class="para-p">Beyond, one of the triremes was bilged and half sunk, its top deck now resting almost at water level and listing to starboard. Bodies, blood, and jagged burned holes covered the deck. The second trireme was already moving unsteadily toward Shappa Ta’atan, twisting back and forth in the current. The Shappans had themselves a prize.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page222" title="222"/>
<p class="para-p">Then the trireme suddenly straightened, the rowers on both decks pulling together.</p>
<p class="para-p">That was impossible. Hesperians learned fast, but not that fast.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Shappa Ta’atani had Roman prisoners at the oars.</p>
<p class="para-p">Well, <em class="char-i">that</em> made all the difference.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols’ allies aimed to take the trireme and the two dragon ships to berth at Shappa Ta’atan. The Roman prisoners would become slaves of the Mongols or die terribly at their hands.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Futete,” Marcellinus said yet again. “Taianita, go find Hanska. Otho! Ifer!”</p>
<p class="para-p">But it was Vibius Caecina who came to him first. Pale, sick, and shaking, the tribune saluted him. “You’re needed on the rear deck, sir. Our Praetor is down.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">On the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> and the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> the remaining Mongols had been crushed. The decks were littered with corpses, and the scuppers ran with blood. Roman sailors were dragging the bodies to the side and dumping them ignominiously into the river.</p>
<p class="para-p">But the victory had come at a terrible cost to the Sixth Ferrata. Calidius Verus was smashed and bloodied, his legs crumpled under him. He coughed, and blood welled over his lower lip and spilled onto his chest. The Praetor clearly had only minutes to live.</p>
<p class="para-p">By Verus’s side stood another tribune. Marcellinus eyed him uncertainly. “Gaius Marcellinus reporting.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Getting no response, Marcellinus leaned forward. “And you are, sir?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The tribune blinked and focused on him. “Aurelius Dizala, First Tribune.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded. “Your orders, sir?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Orders?” Dizala looked around and shook his head. “Dear God, man, my Praetor is not even dead yet. A moment’s peace if you would be so kind.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page223" title="223"/>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, sir.” Marcellinus looked back at the trireme moving slowly across the river. “No. Sir, I’m afraid we don’t have that luxury. This cannot wait.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Caecina took a step back. Dizala looked him up and down. “Gaius Marcellinus. It was your decision to ram your own flagship? You gave that order?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I did, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“If that’s how you treat your friends, God alone knows how you deal with your enemies.” Dizala shook his head. “It was well done. Unorthodox but…”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It was a close thing, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Dizala looked down at Verus and up again at Marcellinus. “Very well. Report.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“The quinqueremes are secure. Most Mongol ships in flight. But two drekars and a trireme have been captured by the Shappa Ta’atani and are under way for the city. They have Roman prisoners.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Dizala looked very tired. “I would think the right course of action was apparent.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It is, sir,” Marcellinus said. “Let us finish this once and for all. Praetor Calidius Verus wanted the Sixth to retain control of the Hesperian Nile. Crush Shappa Ta’atan now, rescue our prisoners, and Roma will hold the Mizipi. But I cannot commit your troops without your orders.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It seems to me you already have.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus grinned. “That was expediency in battle.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Verus coughed, his hands flailing weakly. Dizala knelt and wiped the new blood from his commander’s mouth. The Praetor’s head was lolling, and he was obviously no longer aware of his surroundings.</p>
<p class="para-p">Life was draining from Calidius Verus. Marcellinus would never berate him for his drunkenness or his failures of command or achieve any kind of peace over the matter of Corbulo. None of that mattered anymore.</p>
<p class="para-p">Dizala passed his hand over his eyes. He glanced at Caecina and then away. “Candidly, Marcellinus, I’m not up to any more today. You’ve crossed swords with these barbarians before? Then yours is the crest. Give the orders. Deal with them. Caecina, the field is Marcellinus’s. Give him your support.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page224" title="224"/>
<p class="para-p">Caecina nodded dumbly. Marcellinus saluted. “Yes, sir.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Legionaries ran. Under Marcellinus’s and Ifer’s commands the soldiers from the two dead ships divided themselves between the <em class="char-i">Fides</em> and the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>. The injured were helped to one or another of the navigable quinqueremes. Scorpios, shields, rope, and other vital equipment were passed from the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>’s deck to the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>. Undamaged oars were brought up from belowdecks to replace those of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> that had been smashed in the battle.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked around with grim satisfaction. Despite his harsh thoughts about the Sixth Ferrata, they were now working as one, everyone moving on the double, everyone knowing his job and rushing to get it done. Meanwhile, at the prow of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> and belowdecks, sailors and legionaries worked to cut the quinquereme loose with axes, saws, and levers. Otho was up front with them, his shouting and cursing almost louder than the banging and hammering of his crew. Oarsmen were already seated at their stations in the aft of the quinquereme, ready to row once they were able. The hortator and the drummer stood ready to give them the pace.</p>
<p class="para-p">The warship shook several times, and its prow lifted. Otho looked back at Marcellinus and gave him the high sign.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Go,” Marcellinus said. “Back up, slowly.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The hortator nodded. Marcellinus heard his brisk instruction to the crew, and the drum began to beat time. As the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> backwatered, the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> slumped even lower, muddy water rippling across its top deck.</p>
<p class="para-p">Side by side, the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> and the <em class="char-i">Fides</em> rowed for Shappa Ta’atan. The captured dragon ships were at the shore now, their prize crews jumping off and joining the rest of the Shappan army at the water’s edge. The trireme was still offshore.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay looked behind them and all around. “We’re going to Shappa Ta’atan? Just us?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page225" title="225"/>
<p class="para-p">“Just us?” Marcellinus laughed. “You weren’t at Ocatan, Enopay. Even tired, even outnumbered, the Sixth will destroy them.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“If the Shappans were smart, they would hide behind their great walls.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Let them. We’ll have those walls down in moments.” Marcellinus jerked a thumb behind him. On his prior orders the onagers on both the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> and the <em class="char-i">Fides</em> were being loaded for action.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Look.” Hanska was pointing downriver.</p>
<p class="para-p">The eight junks of Subodei Badahur had not engaged the two quinqueremes in the rear of the fleet. Carrying full sail, they had passed them by. Junks were heading to the shore on each side of the river, presumably to pick up the artillery crews manning the trebuchets, while the rest held formation and sailed on. The Tlingit and the Maya were leaving, too, rowing their brightly colored canoes and longboats close to the riverbank, where the Roman warships could not easily go, following Badahur.</p>
<p class="para-p">“The Mongols have abandoned the Shappans,” Enopay said in wonder.</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita stared at the walls of Shappa Ta’atan. “They must be feeling really fucking stupid right about now.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Her venom daunted them all. Hanska regarded the girl with some concern.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay looked around him at the resolute Roman crew. “This is going to be a bloodbath, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes,” Marcellinus said. “Yes, it is.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No, it isn’t,” said the ship’s master, Titus Otho. “They’re surrendering.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sure enough, the Shappa Ta’atani warriors on the bank were laying their weapons down on the ground and stepping back. Behind them the gates of the city were swinging open in capitulation, with men disappearing from the battlements to file out onto the riverbank, unarmed. The trireme’s gangplank was now down, the Shappans walking calmly off the ship onto dry land while the freed Romans mustered on its top deck.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page226" title="226"/>
<p class="para-p">“<em class="char-i">Damn</em> it,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Otho looked at him sideways. “We could still…?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus shook his head, his heart heavy. Much as his blood still boiled, much as he would have loved to have his revenge on Son of the Sun, he could hardly order a legion to attack unarmed Hesperians.</p>
<p class="para-p">Otho shrugged and gave the order, and the hortator slowed the drums.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I know these people,” Marcellinus said. “We’ll land to accept the surrender. We’ll need troops from the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> to secure the banks, confiscate the weapons. While we’re doing that, hold the other ships offshore at the ready in case of treachery. Scorpios up, onagers and ballistas armed.” He looked at the Mizipian city again and at the Shappans now kneeling on the bank and muttered under his breath. There would be no resistance.</p>
<p class="para-p">“No!” Taianita’s cry was so harsh that it sounded as if it were tearing the skin of her throat. She ran off the poop deck and slumped to the deck, head in her hands.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hanska?” Marcellinus said, but the warrior was already going to talk to the girl.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Phew,” Enopay said in heartfelt relief.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus just kept shaking his head.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I know you want to hurt them,” the boy said. “You and Taianita. Kill them all. But they are Hesperian. They did not ask for this. And our men are tired. If the fighting is over for today, you must be glad.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was certainly weary. Exhausted, in fact. And of course he knew that if the full force of Roma came down upon Shappa Ta’atan, hundreds of innocent people would be killed and injured and suffer terribly in other ways. But for once, he could barely stand to be magnanimous in victory. “Please be quiet, Enopay,” he said, and went forward to prepare an honor guard.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The Shappa Ta’atani council of elders and clan chiefs claimed that Son of the Sun had fled the city, although he might just as well have been hiding in the Shappan sacred area. They insisted that he had betrayed them as well as Roma and that if he attempted to return, they would bind him and deliver him to Marcellinus. They pledged renewed allegiance to Roma, although Marcellinus did not believe them for a moment.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page227" title="227"/>
<p class="para-p">Standard Roman military protocol would have been to take hostages, the oldest sons or daughters of leading chiefs and elders, to accompany them back to Cahokia as an assurance of continued allegiance in the future. Marcellinus rejected that approach. He was not about to take slaves in Roma’s name. Leave such barbarism for the Mongols. Nor would he deprive anyone of their children.</p>
<p class="para-p">Instead he demanded tribute, and in large quantities: corn and beans and sunflower oil, fish and ash cakes and whatever else they had. The Shappa Ta’atani soon opened their granaries to the galleys’ quartermasters.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus informed them that the Romans would be making castra on the far bank overnight and leaving the next morning but that a strict watch would be kept, and if any Shappan vessel so much as touched the water overnight, it would be destroyed and Shappa Ta’atan would be pounded to rubble the next morning. The Shappans promptly took every canoe, dugout, and coracle inside the gate. Marcellinus demanded that the Shappan homesteads on the eastern shore of the Mizipi be evacuated and remain empty overnight to ensure the security of the Roman legion, and three Shappan elders accompanied two Norse knarrs across the river to hurry the homesteaders in packing up and leaving.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Shappans showed every sign of being a people vanquished and compliant, yet Marcellinus was rock-solid in his conviction that even if the bulk of the Shappa Ta’atani this time remained allies of Roma and Cahokia, he had not seen the last of Son of the Sun.</p>
<p class="para-p">By dusk, the Roman fleet was moored and its soldiers and sailors were eating. Guards had been set, and Marcellinus finally was able to sit down on the bank and stare at the remains of the sunset over Shappa Ta’atan. The tribunes wanted to speak with him, but they could wait. Enopay wanted to talk, but Marcellinus sent him away with Hanska and Taianita.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page228" title="228"/>
<p class="para-p">He needed a few moments to himself, and it was only now that it finally sank in that the day had been a success.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Sixth Ferrata had taken losses, including its Praetor, but they had achieved their goals. They had broken the blockade and vanquished the Mongol fleet. The Hesperian Nile was Roman again, even if in reality they now lacked the ships and troops to police it.</p>
<p class="para-p">That would have to be sufficient for today. But one day a reckoning between Marcellinus and the Shappan chief must surely come.</p></div></body></html>

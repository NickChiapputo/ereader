<p class="para-pf-alt" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">“A</span>nd so Lucius Agrippa was wrong and Decinius Sabinus was right. You are apparently worth keeping alive after all. Despite the chaos that inevitably follows in your wake.”</p>
<p class="para-p">At a loss to know how to respond, Marcellinus settled for: “Thank you, Caesar.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator Hadrianus looked at him sideways. “There were, I am sure, several in the city who were similarly gratified to learn of your survival.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded noncommittally. “Perhaps, Caesar.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus studied him. Marcellinus was in full-dress Roman uniform for the first time in many months, but perhaps his formal clothing could not disguise his greatly changed mood. Even a meeting with the Imperator of the known world could not dampen Marcellinus’s immense feeling of relaxed satisfaction after his night with Sintikala.</p>
<p class="para-p">Having seen the imago flying at the finial once again, Marcellinus had crossed the river to the fortress of the Third Parthica by midmorning, but the Imperator had kept him waiting for several more hours. Maybe turnabout was fair play, or maybe Hadrianus really had more pressing business than dealing with his rogue Praetor. It was now a little after midday, and Marcellinus was alone with the Imperator in the Principia building. Sabinus was drilling his men in the grasslands beyond.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page248" title="248"/>
<p class="para-p">Apparently Hadrianus was not dismayed by what he saw. “Bassus says that it was well done. That no man could have done more to try to save Roman lives at Yupkoyvi than you did.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I only wish I had succeeded.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator raised his eyebrows and continued to pace. “Yet you worked your utmost to save them, careless of your own life.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I believed we were all dead anyway, so why not sell our lives as dearly as possible?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Quite, quite. And in addition, Bassus claims that you are the only reason that any of you survived your meeting with the Khan. You seem to have the man quite besotted.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Now Marcellinus shook his head. “Decurion Sextus Bassus showed great courage in the face of a gruesome injury and a ruthless enemy. Pezi was invaluable and remained calm when another word slave might have frozen or fled. I feel his loss keenly. Hanska’s valor impressed the Mongol Khan at a crucial moment, even if her husband had to die to make it so.” He thought about it. “In fact, we few are alive because we all stood together. Roman, Cahokian, Iroqua, Chitimachan…I believe it serves as a good object lesson.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And I need such a lesson?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I spoke generally, Caesar. A lesson for Lucius Agrippa, perhaps.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus looked amused. “Remarkably candid, Gaius Marcellinus. And then the victory on the river, smashing the Mongol blockade and bloodying Badahur’s nose, preserving the bulk of the Sixth Ferrata. The credit for that goes to Taianita, perhaps? Or Enopay?”</p>
<p class="para-p">In fact, both had provided significant help in their way, but even in Marcellinus’s mild euphoria he was still wise enough to know he was testing his Imperator’s patience. He dipped his head deferentially.</p>
<p class="para-p">“The officers of the Sixth are calling it your victory. Marcellinus’s Victory on the Mizipi. I’m encouraged to learn that presiding over crushing defeat is not all you’re capable of.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I suppose that all depends on how you define defeat,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Insolence, Gaius Marcellinus?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page249" title="249"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus just shook his head and smiled. He was weary of minding his language around the Imperator, and after all this he hardly believed Hadrianus was looking for an excuse to execute him.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I would perhaps think better of such a victory,” Hadrianus said carefully, “if you had not taken the opportunity to award yourself a field promotion all the way back up to your former rank.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Not so. I requested no promotion and was granted none by the officers of the Sixth Ferrata. Where possible, I took my direction from Calidius Verus or, once he fell, from First Tribune Aurelius Dizala.” He paused. “However, when orders were unavailable, I acted on my own initiative.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Any centurion could have given you orders, Gaius Marcellinus.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps. But I saw a job that needed doing, and I did it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And you did it.” Hadrianus nodded. “Well, then. Given Calidius Verus’s ineptitude, perhaps it is just as well that you were there.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Verus was not inept,” Marcellinus said somberly. “He had…May I be candid and…?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator nodded, gestured. Marcellinus poured himself a splash of the Imperator’s wine, diluted it with three times as much water, and examined it carefully. “Verus was not my kind of general. He was too prone to hasty decisions. Too far removed from his men.” He looked at Hadrianus. “Too damned patrician.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator looked at him wide-eyed, pretending to be scandalized. “Can such a thing be possible?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It can.” Marcellinus sipped the wine. “In the pinch, Verus made errors, and one of them killed him. But his plan to break through the blockade was sound. He led the charge. He died well, doing his duty to Roma and to his men.” Marcellinus had not forgotten Verus’s words about saving his choice Falernian wines from his fortress in the gulf, or that last bottle he had sent his adjutant, Furnius, down to fetch from the hold of the stricken <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> that had almost resulted in the man’s death. But there was scant reason now to recount such sins. Quite deliberately, Marcellinus raised his beaker in a silent toast to the man, took another tiny sip, then put it down. “Calidius Verus died bravely, and we should remember him well. And now I should like to return to Cahokia.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page250" title="250"/>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator shook his head. “I believe you have had too much desert sun, Gaius Marcellinus, and have forgotten who gives the orders here.”</p>
<p class="para-p">This time, Marcellinus relented. “My apologies, Caesar. I confess I am still extremely weary from the journey. But, with your leave…Caesar, I should like to be discharged from the army of Roma. If you believe that I have played a useful role over the past year and a half, then I am glad of it. If you think I have not, then I will be of no further use to you in any case. By my accounting, and even excluding my years in exile, I have now served in the Roman armed forces for more than twenty-five years. I thus beg you to discharge me and let me retire to Cahokia as a private citizen.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator seemed amused. “That would be inconvenient, Gaius Marcellinus, since I have just decided to make your field appointment a permanent one.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“My appointment, Caesar?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus waved his hand casually as if it were a matter of trivial import. “The Ironclads are short of a Praetor. Luckily, I appear to have a spare one.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus stared at him. “Preposterous.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator raised his eyebrows. “And now you go <em class="char-i">too</em> far in your informality, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus bowed and struggled to recover. “My profound apologies, Caesar. For a deluded moment I had thought your intent was to appoint me as Praetor of the Sixth Ferrata, which would be…” He trailed off.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I did honor you with a legion once before, Gaius Marcellinus, if you recall. Regretfully, you lost it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded. “Exactly my point, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“In your defense, it was not a very <em class="char-i">good</em> legion.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Suddenly Marcellinus’s face was hot, and he could not help himself. “With all due respect…you are quite wrong, Caesar. They were fine soldiers and a fine legion. And their loss will be on my head for the rest of my life.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page251" title="251"/>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus held his eye and nodded. “Good man.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Me?” In Marcellinus’s sudden anger, it took him a few moments to realize the Imperator had yet again been testing him.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of course, of course. And so I now offer you the chance to redeem yourself. I offer you permanent command of the Legio VI Ferrata.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus stared. Once again the earth had fallen away from beneath his feet.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, man?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps you are jesting with me?” Marcellinus inquired cautiously. “After all, you must have a dozen competent tribunes you could elevate.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, but none are local experts…Are you always this argumentative? Ah, yes, I remember now: constantly.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“My apologies,” Marcellinus said. “I have perhaps forgotten how to behave in civilized society.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Surely, surely.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator poured himself more wine and water. He topped up Marcellinus’s beaker and handed it to him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus stared at it. “Let me put that another way. I wonder if you have given sufficient consideration to the other tribunes of the Sixth and how they would feel about being passed over for advancement.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Feel?” Hadrianus shook his head dismissively. “None of them have what it takes to lead the Sixth, and if they don’t know that yet, it’s time they learned.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Aurelius Dizala has served nobly. By all accounts he made a splendid First Tribune for Calidius Verus.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Then he will make you a fine First Tribune, too,” Hadrianus pointed out. “But as it happens it is the recommendation of Aurelius Dizala, in addition to the fine if occasionally grudging words spoken on your behalf by other tribunes and men of the Sixth, that confirms my belief that this is the correct course of action.” The Imperator took a drink of his wine. “And so? Second chances come all too rarely, Gaius Marcellinus. Do you want to command the Sixth or don’t you?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page252" title="252"/>
<p class="para-p">All of a sudden the world shifted around Marcellinus as it dawned on him that he <em class="char-i">did</em> want to. Very much indeed. “Holy Jove.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The thought came as such a shock that he mistrusted it. Pouring his wine into the refuse jug at the rear of the table, he instead filled the beaker with pure, clear water and drank it down slowly. Had he gone mad?</p>
<p class="para-p">Before he said another word it seemed important to analyze where this sudden desire had its roots. “A moment to ponder your offer, Caesar, if you please?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“By all means.”</p>
<p class="para-p">His many failures notwithstanding, Marcellinus had faith in his skills as a leader of men. Again and again he had proved himself a good general and tactician. Despite the dangers and the losses the Sixth had taken, and despite his exhaustion afterward, the river battle at Shappa Ta’atan had invigorated him. It had been his first significant military victory in a decade, and he felt the power of that.</p>
<p class="para-p">In a way, perhaps an unworthy, perverse way, Marcellinus had missed military command. Ripped out of his former life by a slaughter, perhaps at last he could finally admit that he had missed leading men in battle in a noble cause.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus wanted his revenge on the Khan. Not for his invasion of Nova Hesperia, but for his murder of the Romans and the People of the Hand, of Mikasi, Cha’akmogwi, Chochokpi. Even for his enslavement of Pezi, a young man who had finally begun to show promise and whom Marcellinus had vowed would never be enslaved again.</p>
<p class="para-p">And for that revenge he needed to lead, not just react. Up till now Marcellinus had merely stepped into the breach where necessary. He had taken command of the reserve cavalry at Yupkoyvi, for whatever use that had been, and had next stamped his authority on the river battle at Shappa Ta’atan. But that had all been reactive, contingent on the events happening around him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Just the night before, Marcellinus had told Sintikala he was weary of war. That was still true. Marcellinus heartily wished war did not have to come. But if it did, he needed to be the man to wage it.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page253" title="253"/>
<p class="para-p">His lovemaking with Sintikala had been one new beginning. Perhaps it was time for another.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Gaius Marcellinus, have you perhaps fallen asleep on your feet?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Truly, I had never thought to be a Praetor again. I wished to give the matter the respect it deserves.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Just so,” Hadrianus murmured.</p>
<p class="para-p">By all the gods, Marcellinus wanted to direct some significant hurt onto the Mongol Khan, Jebei Noyon, Subodei Badahur, and the rest of the Horde. And he wanted to do it with some power and authority. If he had to wage war, he needed to do so as an equal to Sabinus and Agrippa. Marcellinus’s understanding of this land and its people was greater than theirs, and his opinions should count for at least as much.</p>
<p class="para-p">Winning this war would take the best of both Hesperia and Roma. Too often Marcellinus had seen auxiliaries squandered as spear fodder, sent in first to soften up the enemy at a terrible cost in casualties. That could not be allowed to happen here. And the slaughter they had witnessed at Yupkoyvi could not be allowed to happen in Cahokia, either.</p>
<p class="para-p">And beyond that?</p>
<p class="para-p">Even if the joint forces of Roma and the Hesperian League could overcome the immense Mongol threat, then one day there must be a reckoning between Roma and Hesperia if the land was ever to be free. And in that reckoning, the more influence Marcellinus could bring to bear on the situation, the better.</p>
<p class="para-p">And a Praetor wielded much more influence than a common foot soldier.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had to accept this commission. Offered the white plumed helmet of a Praetor again, he really had no choice but to wear it. Duty called.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus realized that Imperator Hadrianus had sat down on his couch to wait patiently. As he might wait for someone whose opinion mattered. That, too, had changed.</p>
<p class="para-p">As he stared, the Imperator looked up. “And so?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus bowed. “Imperator Hadrianus, having thought it through at…” Perhaps some self-deprecating humor was called for. “At quite considerable length, I would like to accept the command of the Legio VI Ferrata. However, to be easy in my heart about it, I should like to make some requests of you.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page254" title="254"/>
<p class="para-p">“Aha.” The Imperator grinned. “And so the haggling begins?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It’s best we both be clear. We would not want unpleasant surprises later.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, quite.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus took a deep breath. “I will accept the Praetorship of the Sixth. I will train its cohorts for battle and command them to the best of my abilities in the coming war with the armies of the Mongol Khan.” He began to pace, a restless energy filling his limbs. “Right now, they are broken and disheartened. They have lost their previous Praetor, and some among them may think less than highly of me, so it will require some hard work.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus nodded.</p>
<p class="para-p">“However, in addition to commanding the Sixth, I would also request to command the Hesperian forces in battle. While the Cahokians will resist the idea of being absorbed into a Roman legion, I should like us to proceed as if the Cahokian fighters are essentially auxiliary cohorts within the Sixth.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Doubling the size of your command. A shrewd move, Gaius Marcellinus.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“More than doubling. At the current time the surviving Sixth numbers some two and a half thousand men; when the centuries that maintain the Oyo garrison rejoin us, perhaps three thousand. I am hoping for a considerably larger number of Hesperians once all the councils are concluded.” He cocked an eye at the Imperator. “Most of whom I brought to the table in the first place, if you’ll recall.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps. Go on.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I will accept your commission as Praetor. However, when the war is successfully won and the Mongol Horde sent to burn in Hades, I would request to be discharged from the Roman army here in Nova Hesperia rather than withdrawing to Europa with you and the rest of the legions.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page255" title="255"/>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator smiled faintly. “You assume our legions will withdraw from Nova Hesperia at the conclusion of this campaign?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I certainly assume our treaty with Cahokia will continue while Tahtay and the Great City continue to show good faith. And in fact, I would plan to appoint some of my adjutants from the ranks of our auxiliaries. Throughout my career I have seen the virtue of employing local talent as adjutants and would wish to continue that practice.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus shrugged. “You need not trouble me with such minutiae.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Good. Next, there is the issue of the Damnatio Memoriae on myself and the Fighting 33rd. Naturally, it would be untenable for a disgraced general to be given the command of another legion.” Marcellinus stared at his Imperator. “And the 33rd should not have borne the disgrace in the first place. Thus the Damnatio must be lifted, Caesar.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Must?” Hadrianus said with evident amusement.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus held his gaze. “Must.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Then consider it done, Gaius Marcellinus. But in return you must surely recall that elevation back to the Praetorship would require the rededication of your oath of allegiance to your Imperator? A personal oath, to me?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of course. And I will pledge that oath. But prior to that, I have one final matter to bring to your attention.” Marcellinus took a deep breath. “I have a family in Cahokia.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus raised an eyebrow. “Not merely a daughter? A wife and children?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Wife? “It is a little more tangled than that. But suffice it to say that I have loved ones in the city, and as a man of honor I cannot abandon them when I take up command of the Sixth. Local dalliances and even marriages are hardly unheard of in the Roman army, and so I trust this will not be an issue…but now I see that you know of it already, Caesar.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus was grinning. “Again you underestimate me, Gaius Marcellinus. I have known for some time. And how will Sintikala and Kimimela react to your new responsibilities, do you suppose?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page256" title="256"/>
<p class="para-p">Any relief Marcellinus might have felt was instantly quenched by his sudden fear. Hadrianus laughed uproariously at his expression. “Come, man, I am the Imperator of Roma. It is my job to know things. Your darlings are wholly unaware that I have known for months of their importance to you. I see no reason why this should need to change.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus did his best to recover. “Hard to predict how they will react. I will do my best to explain it to them.” Immediately he felt he was being patronizing.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, it is hardly in my interests to jeopardize Roma’s rapport with the chief of the Hawk clan. Face the wrath of Sintikala?” Hadrianus shook his head. “Too rich for my blood. But I must say, it is a splendid strategic move on your part.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Still disconcerted, Marcellinus tried to match his Imperator’s jocularity. “Yes, sir; strategy was always the motive uppermost in my mind.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Is there anything else, or have we reached the end of your list of demands?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I believe I have finished,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Very good. Then let us be clear on one final point. Misjudging me can be a fatal mistake, Gaius. Try to never do it again.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded. That was undoubtedly a threat. Yet it was also the first time the Imperator had ever called him familiarly by his praenomen without formally adding his cognomen, as was the custom in patrician society. The combination made for a peculiar mixed message.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I have never doubted it, Caesar,” he said. “And so I shall do my very best.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And so, Gaius, what will be your first orders to your new legion?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Gratefully, Marcellinus stepped onto safer ground. “We must allow the Sixth to rest from their long journey, but they also need work to do. We broke the Mongol blockade but took substantial losses in doing so, and this shortly after a vicious setback to the legion down in the Mare Solis. At the moment they are reliant on the Third and 27th for accommodations. This must be a further blow to their pride. We must get them back on their feet.</p>
<p class="para-p">“They must build a fortress of their own. The Cahokians can provide lumber and the other legions can contribute nails and other materials, but the Sixth must build it themselves, with no assistance. It must be situated on the west side of the Mizipi, perhaps south of the fortress of the Third Parthica where the river bends. There are no Cahokian homesteads in that area.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page257" title="257"/>
<p class="para-p">“Logistics aside, I’ll need to stamp quick authority upon them. As you have pointed out, I have already acquired some capital among the tribunes. However, First Centurion Appius Gallus may be a problem if not dealt with promptly. One of my first duties will be to have a stern talk with him. After that, I’ll meet with my centurions.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus pondered. “We must proceed in the correct order. Give me leave to broach this with our allies? In the interests of keeping relations smooth, Tahtay and the elders and clan chiefs must be briefed first; they must not hear about this through rumor and supposition. So I will meet with the Cahokians and then the tribunes. Thirdly, I will meet with Gallus and my centurions. And then, as soon as is feasible, we will commence construction of our new legionary fortress. Ah.” Another thought had struck him. “Sabinus and Agrippa?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What of them?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps they should be the first to know. Since…” Although the words were in his mind, he found he could not quite say <em class="char-i">We will be working together as equals from now on</em>. Given his history with Agrippa, that might prove to be an interesting experience.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Ah, Gaius, Gaius. They already know, of course.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“They do?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Would I take such a momentous step without consulting my generals? It is the reason you had to wait so long today for an audience.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And they agreed?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“They did. Both of them.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That’s astounding,” Marcellinus said, too surprised to be anything other than honest.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Isn’t it, though? Anyway, the formalities can wait until later. In the meantime…” The Imperator saluted him. “Praetor Gaius Marcellinus of the Legio VI Ferrata: please go about your duties and report back here at dusk to dine with us.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus hesitated. “I thank you for the invitation, but perhaps it might be more appropriate for me to dine with my tribunes on this first evening. I should plunge in. Establish a rapport. Breakfast with you tomorrow instead, perhaps?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page258" title="258"/>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus nodded. “By all means, Praetor. By all means.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus came to attention and saluted. “Thank you, Caesar.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“You must be fucking kidding me,” said Aelfric. “Have they all gone crackers? Have <em class="char-i">you</em>?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Keep your voice down,” Marcellinus said, guiding him toward the Southgate of the fortress of the Third Parthica. “But yes, perhaps they have. And as for me…”</p>
<p class="para-p">Aelfric was shaking his head. “I thought we were doomed before. Now I <em class="char-i">know</em> there’s no hope for us against the Khan.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I need tribunes,” Marcellinus said bluntly.</p>
<p class="para-p">“What?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“The Sixth Ferrata has lost two. I’ll be confirming Manius Ifer as permanent tribune of the Tenth Cohort, but that still leaves the Sixth and Seventh Cohorts swinging in the breeze.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Aelfric scoffed. “Join your lot? Trade a terrific crew like the Third Parthians for the worst legion on the entire continent? Surely you jest.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, they won’t be the worst legion for long.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What’s in it for me?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You? You get a promotion.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Maybe I’m happy where I am.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Maybe you are.”</p>
<p class="para-p">They stepped out of the gate and walked to the bank of the Mizipi. Aelfric was still shaking his head. “The Sixth Ironclads…an honorable name and history and all, but if you’ll permit me to speak freely, I’ve heard some dodgy things about their new commander, and that’s a fact.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I don’t doubt it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Aelfric considered. “I’ll need back pay for all those years I spent in country.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Absolutely not,” Marcellinus said.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page259" title="259"/>
<p class="para-p">“I like having cavalry around me, though, and you don’t have much. I’ve been wondering how I ever allowed myself to go infantry in the first place. All those years doing my own walking when I could’ve gotten an animal to do it for me. And I’ve grown very fond of my horse.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded sagely. “I’m sure you have. You are a Briton, after all.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That’s sheep,” Aelfric said. “Horses are different.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m still negotiating with the other Praetors about cavalry,” Marcellinus admitted. “The Sixth has only a few dozen horsemen of its own. The big alae came across with the Third and 27th. As a start, Sabinus has asked Hadrianus’s permission to assign me the Cohors Equitata IX Thracum Syriaca.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Aelfric looked concerned. “The Ninth Syrian are solid horsemen, but there aren’t many of ’em. Since Sabinus also has the cataphracts of the First Gallorum and two alae of Polovtsians under his command, I’d think he could spare you a few more nags than that. I’ll have a word with him. And, um, since we’re talking about Sabinus…?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, he’s reluctantly agreed to me stealing you for the Sixth. Oh, and I’m prepared to let you spend three nights a week in Cahokia, too, provided it doesn’t interfere with your duties. I’m anxious for the Sixth to pursue closer ties with Cahokia.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, I like the sound of that.” Aelfric looked at him sideways. “That’s what you’re doing? You and Sintikala are overnighting it now?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That’s none of your business.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You are, then.” Aelfric whistled and shook his head. “I’m amazed you’re still alive, you old dog.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus grinned. “A little more deference, Tribune, if you would be so kind.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The next day, the sounds of hammering and swearing could be heard clear across the Mizipi. The Sixth had started before dawn: marched in formation by their various tribunes out of the fortresses of III Parthica and XXVII Augusta Martia Victrix, they were hard at work digging trenches, building ramparts, hauling earth, and hammering together barracks and stable blocks. As the Ironclads were short on engineers, Marcellinus had borrowed some from Sabinus to help lay out the fortress site. That aside, the construction would be performed entirely by the Ironclads. Marcellinus had even sent work squads from the cohorts of Statius Paulinus north with drekars and knarrs to haul the wood that would be needed.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page260" title="260"/>
<p class="para-p">The tribunes of the Sixth Ferrata had welcomed Marcellinus with some relief. If the rank and file had any reservations about their new Praetor, they were shrewd enough to conceal it. If anything, they seemed grateful to have someone competent in command again, a clear line of authority, a new direction. As well as happy to be kept busy with activities that were normal and familiar and, for the most part, did not involve oars.</p>
<p class="para-p">Primus Pilus Appius Gallus was another story.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">From where he and Sintikala stood on the crest of the Great Mound, Marcellinus saw Taianita enter the Great Plaza garbed in leather armor and with a gladius hanging from her belt. He could not see her face from that distance, but her walk was unmistakable, and Cahokian women who fought with the gladius were rare enough. The boys from the Raven clan playing chunkey against their fellows from the Chipmunk clan paused respectfully to let her pass between them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala turned her head to see where he was looking. “Taianita did well on the journey?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“She did,” Marcellinus admitted. “Thought quickly. Worked hard. She got a bit wild during the battle, though.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sometimes a little wildness helps.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps.” Marcellinus cast his gaze back in the other direction, toward the crest of the adjacent Mound of the Sun, where Tahtay was sparring with gladius and spear with Kimimela and Enopay.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had originally trained Tahtay in the use of the gladius. But since then Tahtay had trained extensively on a variety of weapons with the Blackfoot and the Romans, and the result was a curious mix of unorthodox weapon handling and swift footwork that was neither Cahokian, Roman, nor Blackfoot but an odd combination of all of them. Tahtay was a match for anyone now, and Marcellinus was glad that the war chief had not challenged <em class="char-i">him</em> to a sparring match.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page261" title="261"/>
<p class="para-p">Certainly Tahtay was more than enough for Kimimela and Enopay. Kimi was fast with a short spear and club but not as adept with a blade. Enopay hacked away gamely and was a dirty fighter but gave away his every move in advance through his body language. From this distance they could just hear the tone of Tahtay’s voice as he shouted instructions at Enopay while easily parrying his blows and pushing him back.</p>
<p class="para-p">But over and above the training, Marcellinus was happy that they were a tight team. They were his original band of translators, appointed by Great Sun Man, without whom Marcellinus would have been dead several times over by now. He was glad they were important to one another, too.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now Sintikala looked west. “Is your fortress large enough?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Maybe,” he said. “I can’t decide.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala was joking with him. Out of both pride and practicality Marcellinus had insisted that the Sixth construct a fortress even bigger than that of the Third Parthica. The Ironclads would fill only half such a fortress, but the Cahokians needed to become used to living in castra side by side with Roma. When they marched out into the prairie to do battle with the Mongol Khan, they would have to build a night camp and occupy it together. Romans and Hesperians needed to view one another as brothers in arms.</p>
<p class="para-p">Wood was cheap, and Marcellinus had a point to make.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Whoa.” On the Mound of the Sun, Enopay had grabbed a spear and swung it around in a ruthless and unexpected attack on Tahtay’s legs. At the same time Kimimela whirled her club at his head, and it seemed that neither of them was pulling punches. Tahtay tripped over backward, and the sound of laughter radiated from the mound.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m glad he laughs.” In light of the leg wound that had threatened to cripple Tahtay for life, Marcellinus was relieved that he had taken Enopay’s attack so well.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Only with them. His mood is never so light with anyone else.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page262" title="262"/>
<p class="para-p">“He has a lot to think about.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Below them, Taianita was jogging up the cedar stairs of the Great Mound. Sintikala sighed, and her hand slipped out of Marcellinus’s.</p>
<p class="para-p">“So we do not fight the Khan this year?” Not at all out of breath, Taianita climbed the final steps and came to stand on Marcellinus’s other side.</p>
<p class="para-p">“No. By the scouts’ accounts, his army is still divided. Chagatai’s half has crossed the Great Mountains in the north and is camped on the Wemissori. Chinggis’s army is camped on the Braided River. They train, they fatten their horses.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Good,” she said. “More time for <em class="char-i">me</em> to train to fight them.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Over on the Mound of the Sun, Tahtay had jumped up again and taken his revenge. Enopay was sprawled flat on his back, and Tahtay was raining blows onto Kimimela, who was parrying and shrieking in a good-natured way. When Tahtay ran her right off the edge of the mound, she rolled backward and somersaulted to a halt fifteen feet below. Everyone was laughing. Enopay sat up and shouted what was presumably an insult, and Tahtay whirled around and cast his spear, which stuck into the ground safely several feet to the right of the boy.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You are already strong,” Marcellinus pointed out to Taianita. “Capable. You wear war tattoos from three battles. If you could work with Kimimela on gladius, it would help her a great deal.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps, if she asks me.” Taianita turned to Marcellinus. “Somehow you are still allowed on our Sacred Mound even though you are again a big Roman Praetor?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Apparently,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Tahtay is not angry with you?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Relieved. Tahtay immediately saw the advantage of me having influence over the Imperator and the plan for battle. He would rather the warriors of the Hesperian League work with me than with Hadrianus or Decinius Sabinus, let alone Agrippa.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay had also welcomed the news. Kimimela had been a harder sell but had come around once Sintikala pointed out that since Marcellinus had to be a Roman, he would be much safer when surrounded by a mass of other Romans who were pledged to protect him.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page263" title="263"/>
<p class="para-p">It had, of course, been Sintikala’s reaction that Marcellinus had been most concerned about. In an ideal world he would not have scheduled his first night of passion with Sintikala and his reappointment to a Roman generalship within the same few short hours. But Sintikala had taken the development with the same calm acceptance as Tahtay, and now it was Marcellinus who had whiplash.</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita seemed to come to a decision. “Good. Then let me help you, Gaius.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Me? How?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Work with you. With the legion. Let me serve you, as your adj…?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Adjutant.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I can translate. Work with Roma and Cahokia. Fight the Khan. And Son of the Sun, if he ever shows his bastard face again. I will be there, at the front of the battle, with you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus could only imagine the reaction of his tribunes, let alone Appius Gallus, if he appointed an attractive Cahokian woman to his staff as well as a child. For earlier that day he had solicited Enopay to assist him with record keeping and logistics for the Sixth Ferrata, and the boy had accepted with alacrity. Sometimes Marcellinus suspected that Enopay might end up the most Roman of all of them.</p>
<p class="para-p">He stalled. “Let me think about it. Consider how best it might be done.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita saw through him right away. “No, then.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It would be difficult,” he admitted.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Difficult?” She leaned forward, pugnacious now. “I want to help Cahokia. I want to help Roma. Against the Mongols. Do you not hear me?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala was nodding slowly. Marcellinus tried not to look exasperated. “I hear you, Taianita, but—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I want to fight Mongols. What they did to Yupkoyvi…What happened to Kanuna, to Mikasi. What happened to Pezi. And what almost happened to us.” Fierceness burned in Taianita’s eyes. “Gaius, we must drive them from the land. I will do anything, everything to destroy them. As much as I can. If I do not, then I may as well have died a beaten word slave in Shappa Ta’atan—”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page264" title="264"/>
<p class="para-p">“Fly Wakinyan,” Sintikala said suddenly.</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita turned to look at her. “What?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You are strong, smart, agile. Willing to learn. And light. Chenoa would welcome you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita looked at Sintikala and Marcellinus and then up into the sky. It was clear that the idea had never occurred to her, and she was not sure what to make of it. “Thunderbirds? Not Hawks, with you?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Wakinyan first. You cannot learn to be a Catanwakuwa pilot by the spring, when the war will come. Hawk flight is not learned so quickly, and you are starting older than most. If…if we are all here two years from now and you have done well in the Thunderbird clan, then you and I will talk of Catanwakuwa again. For now, Wakinyan. If you learn fast and show promise, perhaps Eagles. Yes?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita looked thoughtful. “Perhaps I do not have the courage.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You do not lack courage.” Sintikala jerked her thumb at Marcellinus. “And if he can do it, you certainly can.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Thanks,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita looked again into the empty sky, and then down at the Great Plaza as if imagining how it might look from many times as high. She shivered suddenly. “Thank you. Let me think. And you, Gaius, you will think too about other ways I can help? I can speak languages. Work hard. You know this.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I will. And I do.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She stood, still looking almost suspiciously up into the sky. Once she was gone, Marcellinus said, “Phew. Thank you for that.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“For what? Taianita would be good under a Wakinyan. And perhaps she could burn hundreds of Mongol warriors all at once, and it would make her feel better.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Even now, Sintikala’s matter-of-factness about human devastation sometimes chilled him. “Maybe so.”</p>
<p class="para-p">On the Mound of the Sun, Tahtay, Kimimela, and Enopay had finished their mock battles and were sitting in a close circle, talking intently. “And what are those three plotting now?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“If I knew, would I tell you?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page265" title="265"/>
<p class="para-p">“Weren’t there supposed to be no secrets between us anymore?” he demanded.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala shrugged and grinned. Her hand crept into his again. “Come into the Longhouse of the Wings with me, then, and I will show you some more secrets.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He blinked. “Must I?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala turned and looked into his eyes.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, yes,” Marcellinus said. “I must.”</p></div></body></html>

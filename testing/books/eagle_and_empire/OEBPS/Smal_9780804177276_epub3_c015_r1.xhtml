<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">T</span>hree weeks later, shortly after the dark of the Hunting Moon, the remains of the Legio VI Ferrata passed the mouth of the Oyo River where it emptied into the Mizipi at Ocatan. Even now, the sight of the four quinqueremes and the accompanying vessels was enough to prompt the Ocatani at the riverbank to hurry back through the gates of their town and bar them. From where Marcellinus stood at the prow of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> he could see Mizipians lining the newly rebuilt town ramparts to watch the Roman ships pass.</p>
<p class="para-p">The oarsmen were not rowing at full speed, and the ships were not in an attack posture. The fighting towers had been dismantled and stowed, the onagers and scorpios were covered, and the legionaries stood easy on deck. The galleys were ragged, with burn and scorch marks along their hulls and blistered paint. The hulls of the <em class="char-i">Fides</em> and <em class="char-i">Minerva</em> and both the prow and the stern of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> had taken significant damage that the Sixth had made only a minimal effort to repair. Marcellinus and the surviving tribunes had agreed that in the aftermath of their tribulations downriver, appearances could be neglected till the crew joined up with the rest of the Roman army at Cahokia and had a chance to recuperate.</p>
<p class="para-p">With so many troops injured or exhausted it was hard enough to row the massive galleys against the incessant Mizipi current and build a secure camp on the shore every night. Over the last months the Sixth Ferrata had suffered both a major defeat and a Pyrrhic victory; they had prevailed at the blockade but had lost their commander, two tribunes, and more centurions than Marcellinus could count. The quartermaster and Enopay agreed that in all the Sixth was approaching Cahokia with a mere 2,500 men out of the 4,800 with which it had begun the year. More than five hundred men were injured, and every day brought more deaths as men finally succumbed to their wounds.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page230" title="230"/>
<p class="para-p">Understandably, the mood aboard the ships was dour. Among the tribunes Aurelius Dizala was grimly competent and nominally in command but prone to black depressions at the death of his Praetor and the damage to his legion. Flavius Urbicus, tribune of the Sixth and Seventh Cohorts and a popular man, had died two days after the river battle of wounds sustained defending the hospital ship <em class="char-i">Clementia</em>. The only other surviving tribunes were Vibius Caecina, young and disgraced, who avoided Marcellinus wherever possible; Statius Paulinus, hardworking but not really leadership material; and Manius Ifer, whom Marcellinus was coming to respect more and more each day for his gruff pragmatism and down-to-earth good sense.</p>
<p class="para-p">None of the tribunes was really stepping into the role as acting commander, but coordinating the voyage to Cahokia was largely a matter for the ships’ masters in any case. Titus Otho and the other senior centurions who served as ships’ masters of the quinqueremes largely made the navigational decisions among themselves, and woe betide anyone who disagreed with them. As the local expert, Marcellinus liaised among them all and made suggestions that generally were accepted as orders, and the flotilla made as steady and efficient a progress up the river as anyone could have wanted.</p>
<p class="para-p">Unfortunately, the primus pilus of the Sixth, First Centurion Appius Gallus, could scarcely conceal his disdain for and distrust of Marcellinus. Marcellinus could not guess which of his many transgressions might have triggered such a response and did not care. The rank and file respected Marcellinus for his impromptu seizing of command during the battle, and the tribunes all treated him as an equal for the time being; besides, once they were safely back in Cahokia, Marcellinus would never have to see Gallus again. Once the masters and tribunes had accepted that Marcellinus’s was a voice to be listened to, Gallus had to take his orders just as everyone else did. Every primus pilus Marcellinus had known would honor the chain of command even if he believed every officer above him was a chicken or a buffoon, and Appius Gallus was no different.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page231" title="231"/>
<p class="para-p">The Sixth had a small military harbor five miles up the Oyo River, established when they had moved their operations after withdrawing from Ocatan, but it was not sufficient to berth four quinqueremes, a trireme, and the other associated vessels. Besides, the Sixth needed to report to the Imperator posthaste. Thus, the flotilla would proceed straight to Cahokia and fall on the mercy of the other legions for accommodation or assistance in building its own fortress.</p>
<p class="para-p">If they were even capable of such exertion. Rarely in his life had Marcellinus seen a group of men so chronically dog-tired.</p>
<p class="para-p">As was he. There was a limit to what any man could reasonably endure, and Marcellinus felt about as close to his as he had ever been.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The smoke of Cahokia hung in the air. The Great City was just around the next bend in the river. The mood of the men was lightening.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I should like to apologize to you, sir,” came a voice from behind him on the poop deck of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>. Marcellinus turned, half expecting Sextus Bassus, but it was First Tribune Aurelius Dizala, in full uniform and standing to attention.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had not seen Dizala for days, had not even known the tribune had come aboard the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>. “Good grief, Dizala, you outrank me. Congratulations on bringing your legion through hell.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Dizala grunted uncomfortably. “Other men will be the judge of that, sir. Their verdict may not be as gracious.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus studied him. “At ease, then, Tribune. What can I do for you?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Dizala stood easy and walked forward to stand next to him. “You know, sir, I’ve never been this far north in Nova Hesperia. I’ve heard good things about Cahokia.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page232" title="232"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had no idea whom Dizala might have heard them from, but he appreciated the effort. “It’s a fine place.” Perhaps that was a little too glib and the waste of a good opportunity besides. He tried again. “Some from Roma see only barbarians. But if you can open your eyes, you’ll see a grandeur about the city, and a people of fine quality. Look hard and try to understand them, if for no other reason than that understanding them may help Roma win this war.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Dizala shuffled his feet. “I wanted to apologize to you for my behavior and actions during the battle. I would like to think them uncharacteristic.” He turned to face Marcellinus. “I have never before lost a commanding officer. Not once. I shall not pretend that I liked Praetor Calidius Verus or agreed with all his decisions. But it was…” He faced forward again. “Battle can be an awful thing.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It can,” Marcellinus said. “And I do not accept your apology, for you have no need to make it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Be that as it may…” Dizala held out his hand. “I cannot predict how the Imperator Hadrianus will judge our actions over the past months, either yours or mine. But I declare that I shall speak highly of you to him, whatever comes of it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus clasped the tribune’s arm. “As will I when recounting your actions, for whatever that may be worth to the Imperator.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Very good, sir.” Dizala stepped back and came to attention. “With your permission, I will instruct Otho and the men to ready the ship for berthing.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus grinned. “Please proceed, Aurelius Dizala. And if you see Enopay, please send him forward to me. Oh, and if I might ask a favor?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Name it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“When we arrive in Cahokia, Bassus will report to the Imperator on the expedition’s behalf and you will report on behalf of the Sixth. Yes?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I suppose so. Along with yourself, I presume.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That is the favor. I would prefer not to go straight to Hadrianus.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Dizala looked perturbed. “It may be unwise to delay.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Indeed. But I have been away from home a long time, and there are people I must see just as soon as possible.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page233" title="233"/>
<p class="para-p">“People who outrank the Imperator?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked again at the smoke from the hearth fires rising above Cahokia and said nothing.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Never mind,” Dizala said. “Of course, I’ll cover as best I can. You’ll come soon?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Soon enough, First Tribune. You may depend on it. Please impress upon Hadrianus that I am not attempting to run off, evade his judgment, or anything of that nature. I merely have obligations elsewhere for a few hours. I hope he will understand.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Run away?” Dizala grinned. “If that were your goal, you’d have done it long before now.”</p>
<p class="para-p">They came around the slow turn, and Marcellinus’s heart lurched as the view of the great mounds of Cahokia opened up before them. Two Sky Lanterns floated in the air above the Master Mound, and at a much greater altitude a half dozen Catanwakuwa flitted back and forth, looping around a stately Wakinyan in some complicated aerial maneuver. His breath caught in his throat.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, you’re in luck, sir. Looks like Himself is not at home and you get a breather after all.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The imago of the Imperator was at half mast over the fortress of the Legio III Parthica. Hadrianus was not there. Out on exercise, perhaps. “It appears that at last my luck is changing.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps,” Dizala said. “Have a good homecoming, sir.” The tribune saluted and went back to talk to Titus Otho.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Yet again, Marcellinus returned to Cahokia battered, bruised, and war-weary.</p>
<p class="para-p">This time he walked in alone and almost unregarded in a Cahokian tunic and moccasins, with a cloth draped over his head against the sun. It was the middle of the day, and many people were sheltering in their huts from the heat. On the streets he saw no one he recognized, and nobody seemed to recognize him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Somewhere behind him were Hanska and Enopay, the only other Cahokians left alive. In the last week of the journey they both had become increasingly taciturn; the closer they got to Cahokia, the more they felt the intense grief of losing Mikasi and Kanuna. For each, the return to Cahokia would be bittersweet. Marcellinus would have been by their sides if they had asked, but they seemed to take more solace in their shared bereavement.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page234" title="234"/>
<p class="para-p">The tall statuesque Hanska and the small but shrewd Enopay made an odd pair, but Marcellinus had grown accustomed to unlikely friendships over the last few years. They had their pain in common, and he was content to leave them to reconnect with Cahokia in their own time. As for Taianita and the Chitimachan, Marcellinus did not even know which quinquereme they were traveling on, and despite his increased respect for them would not have chosen either as a companion for his return to the Great City.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was the first time he had been truly alone for months. All in all, it was an oddly contemplative walk. Hardly a hero’s welcome and all the better for that. He made it all the way to the Great Plaza before meeting someone he knew, and even then he did not recognize her right away. “Chumanee?”</p>
<p class="para-p">He was mortified for startling her when she backed away, wide-eyed. “Chumanee, is everything all right?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Wanageeska…” Already she was scanning his arms and legs, looking for damage. “You are not hurt?”</p>
<p class="para-p">A legionary medicus aboard the <em class="char-i">Clementia</em> had long since treated Marcellinus’s burn injury and the arrow hole in his shoulder. The wound in his calf was the only one visible. That was healing now, and it was anyway on the site of a previous wound, and so even Chumanee had not noticed it right away.</p>
<p class="para-p">For once Marcellinus had no need of her services. “I am well. And you?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“But how?” Chumanee asked, apparently mystified. And then a movement caught their eyes, and they both turned to look up the Great Mound.</p>
<p class="para-p">A slender figure was hurtling down the mound. A girl, running like the wind with her hair flaring out behind her.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Kimimela,” Chumanee said. Marcellinus squinted. Was it really? The girl seemed too tall, and different in other ways he could not quite place.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page235" title="235"/>
<p class="para-p">How old was Kimimela now, anyway? Sixteen winters?</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela slipped and tumbled, rolled, and came springing back up onto her feet in what seemed like an impossible single motion. Kept running as if nothing had happened, down onto level ground. She disappeared briefly behind the palisade at the foot of the mound, then came sprinting out of the big gates toward them.</p>
<p class="para-p">At the last moment Marcellinus had the presence of mind to brace and lean forward. Kimimela launched herself and flew into his arms. He staggered back under the impact, Chumanee stepping smartly aside to avoid them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela’s eyes were wide. Her hair hung loose. She kissed his cheek experimentally and then seemed to freeze in place. “Huh.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Kimimela,” he said, lowering her to the ground. She had grown while he was away, was over an inch taller.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You’re alive.” She prodded him, shaking her head as if trying to will herself to believe it. “How, how…?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You didn’t think I’d—ow!” Quick as an eel, she had punched him on the arm. Hard. “Gods, Kimi, you have <em class="char-i">muscles</em> now.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela shook her head, staring, and started to cry.</p>
<p class="para-p">His mouth went dry as he realized the other thing that was different about her. “Your hair? You’re in mourning?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of course I am, you idiot…”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sintikala?” He looked from Kimimela to Chumanee and back again, and a chill surrounded his heart. “What has happened?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sintikala lives,” Chumanee said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“My mother lives; of course she does.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Who, then? Tahtay?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You <em class="char-i">verpa.</em>” Kimimela lashed out, hitting him again on the shoulder, perilously close to his jaw. “Gah! Merda!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You, Wanageeska,” Chumanee said. “Kimi wears her hair in mourning for <em class="char-i">you</em>. Mahkah came home several moons ago. His horse was so lame that the Romans wanted to put it out of its pain, but he would not let them. Still he cares for it, although it will never bear him again. He told us you were all dead, your expedition wiped out by Mongols in the desert by Yupkoyvi.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page236" title="236"/>
<p class="para-p">“Dead,” Kimimela said, suddenly very still and serious. “But you are not.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Almost overwhelmed by the strength of her emotion, Marcellinus reached out. He wanted to wipe away the tears that still trickled down her cheeks, but that seemed an impertinence out here in the plaza. He clutched her arm instead, squeezed. “It must have seemed that way to Mahkah once he crossed the canyon, climbed one of the great stairways, and looked back.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Two months later Isleifur Bjarnason came back with no horse but the same story—”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela suddenly looked up. Above them, a Catanwakuwa lurched sideways in the air and tumbled out of formation. Marcellinus flinched. A broken wing? The Hawk was diving in a steep bank, curving around. “Shit…”</p>
<p class="para-p">It was coming too fast. Marcellinus dropped to one knee and pulled Kimimela down with him. Chumanee crouched on the girl’s other side.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Catanwakuwa shot just a few feet over their heads. It was Sintikala, her hair streaming out behind her.</p>
<p class="para-p">She seemed barely in control of her Hawk. Once past, she flipped it into a near stall, spilling air, and arced around once more, grazing the top of the palisade around the Great Mound. She landed hard, bounced, and skidded, almost dragged over backward.</p>
<p class="para-p">She turned.</p>
<p class="para-p">From thirty feet away, suddenly stock-still, the masked Sintikala regarded him. Marcellinus could see her unblinking eyes behind the mask. Kimimela had filled out while Marcellinus was away; conversely, the Hawk chief seemed gaunt.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala walked toward them, the huge span of her wing still resting across her shoulders. As she approached, she tugged off her mask and dropped it onto the sand of the Great Plaza. Her hair, too, hung loose in mourning.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala walked right up to him. She raised her hands and placed them one on each side of his face. Her palms stroked his cheekbones, and her fingertips pushed hard into the flesh behind his ears. She regarded him for five long breaths. Stared into his eyes and read them.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page237" title="237"/>
<p class="para-p">“Alive,” she said.</p>
<p class="para-p">He swallowed. “Yes. Barely. And at great cost. The others—”</p>
<p class="para-p">She turned and grabbed him. He smelled sweat and leather. She pulled his head down to hers and kissed him. Her hands slipped down onto his shoulders and arms.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes,” she said, as if to herself. “Alive.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Then she turned and strode away around the right-hand side of the Great Mound, abandoning her wing on the plaza behind her.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Great Jove,” Marcellinus said inadequately.</p>
<p class="para-p">“She mourned you,” Kimimela said. “Without ever quite giving up hope. You must understand, when my father died—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I know. She was <em class="char-i">not there</em>. Nor when…” Marcellinus stopped. Even now he could not mention Great Sun Man by name.</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela nodded. “And when you died, she was <em class="char-i">not there</em> either.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala turned the corner and was gone.</p>
<p class="para-p">“But I did not die.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela reached out to touch him on the arm again. “That will take us a little longer to believe. Come.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Where?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“To follow my mother.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Kimimela walked with Marcellinus to the crest of the Mound of the Hawk Chief. The doorskin of Sintikala’s house was closed. No smoke came from the roof.</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela halted and threw her arms around him, hugging him until his breath almost stopped. “You must go in.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“She did not invite me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I believe she did.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus wanted nothing more in the whole world, yet he hesitated. Kimimela poked him, and now there was a glint in her eye. “You are afraid?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Apprehensive. It is not the same.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page238" title="238"/>
<p class="para-p">“I will be at Chenoa’s house.” Kimi pointed to the next mound. “The one that used to be Howahkan’s, then was yours. Don’t forget about me, Gaius. I want to talk with you, too. Remember that you are my father.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Kimi—”</p>
<p class="para-p">She was staring at him with a fixed intensity. “And I am so very, very glad that you did not die.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He reached for her shoulder, touched her face. “I’m so happy I got to see you again. There were times when I…” He swallowed.</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela gave him a little shove. “Not now. Go, idiot. Go to my mother.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“It’s me,” he said. Hearing no response, he pulled the doorskin aside anyway, stepped in, tugged it closed behind him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala’s hut had no windows, but light spilled in through the smoke hole in the ceiling and filtered through cracks in the walls. It was nowhere near as dark as night in the Longhouse of the Wings, but after the brightness of the Cahokian day he could see her only in outline as she walked to him and put her arms around him.</p>
<p class="para-p">He wished he could see her eyes, but perhaps it was just as well that he could not.</p>
<p class="para-p">He put his hands tentatively on her shoulders, and then slipped his arms around her. She still wore the leather flying tunic, but it was loose on her, the front untied. She buried her face in his chest and inhaled deeply, and he felt her ribs and chest swell against him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Those ribs were closer to the surface now. She truly was gaunt. Yet when he stroked her shoulders and arms and felt around her back, she was still as muscular as ever, still a panther in a woman’s skin, hard and strong. “Sisika…”</p>
<p class="para-p">Her fingers found his lips. He kissed them, and they slipped inside his mouth, grazed his teeth. He tasted dirt and leather and Sintikala.</p>
<p class="para-p">Her other hand slipped up under his tunic. It roved across his back and down his side, and he realized she was searching him for new scars or wounds, checking for damage. She leaned back, using both hands to explore his stomach and his chest, his shoulders. She found the new wound in his side, which was still covered with a Roman bandage, and probed it carefully. She lingered over the new scar on his shoulder, now mostly healed, then moved on, her fingertips grazing his nipples as they went on their way. He shivered a little at her touch, at the intentness of her study, but leaned back against the wall and let her do it.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page239" title="239"/>
<p class="para-p">“Gaius Publius Marcellinus,” she whispered.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sisika. Sintikala.” He smiled his joy. “Mighty Hawk chief.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Her hands clasped his upper arms, her fingers sinking into the skin and muscle to grip him tightly. She kissed his chest. He nuzzled her loose hair, found her ear, bent to kiss her neck. She sighed, her breath hot on his skin.</p>
<p class="para-p">He could be patient no longer. He pushed her tunic off her shoulders and shoved it back, and now it was he who explored, searching her, discovering her. His eyes were adjusting, and he could see her now.</p>
<p class="para-p">She wore only a brief linen chemise under the tunic. With true Sintikala-like directness she put her hand up to the neck of the chemise and tore it away, dropping it onto the ground at their feet.</p>
<p class="para-p">The feel of her, the smell of her, began to madden him. He realized he was being too rough, almost mauling her in his urgency, and forced himself to ease up.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala clearly felt no such restraint. If he had not known it for passion, he might have thought himself under attack. Her hands pummeled him, her fingertips scored his arms and back. Her fingernails were always short, bitten back; if they had been long, she would have drawn blood. She was panting, almost growling, and Marcellinus became aware that he was as well. He had wanted this for so long…</p>
<p class="para-p">She shoved him back against the wall, and he felt the wooden staves flex behind him. For a moment he had a vision of the house falling down around them and their bodies being found joined in the wreckage, and he gave a low, almost crazed laugh at the thought of it.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus pulled his tunic up over his head and threw it aside. And now he was naked, his moccasins kicked off and his breechcloth pulled away while he had been distracted with attacking her in his turn.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page240" title="240"/>
<p class="para-p">He ran his hands down her sides as her strong body pushed up against his. He tried to urge her back; he could see her bed now, thirty feet away on the other side of the big room, but even as he made the attempt, he knew they would not take the time to cross even that short distance.</p>
<p class="para-p">Her urgency was palpable. With a moan she kissed his chest, his stomach, went lower to his thighs, as far as the knee. He shouted out and pulled at her, almost frantic now in his passion, and she leaped up into his arms.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus spun her around and shoved her back against the wall. Again the wood creaked, and a wing spar that had rested against the wall clattered to the floor.</p>
<p class="para-p">She grabbed his head, forced it down to her chest, and as he kissed and tasted her, his hands roved lower.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Now,” she said, her voice husky. “Now…”</p>
<p class="para-p">It was time. They both knew it. She gave a little hop, and he seized her hips, lifted her. As he entered her, she cried out, a low sound of passion, and her hands clawed at him, pulling him in deeper. His tongue slid into her mouth, and he rammed her back against the wall again and again, she moaning, he crying her names and other words, Roman curse words, Cahokian words of love.</p>
<p class="para-p">He felt the sensations building within him, and then out of his desperate, feral emotions emerged a thought, crystal clear and perfect: this was Sisika, Sintikala, the woman he loved, and had loved and missed and craved and wanted for years upon years, nigh on a decade now, the woman he thought he could never, ever have. And here they were, desperate for each other, both buried deep in the other in their own ways.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now accustomed to the dim light, his eyes met hers. He looked deep into her and saw in her, too, the raging tension of all those years of love and lust. Those eyes pushed him over the edge now, and a fierce primal joy swept through him and racked him. Her eyes widened, her head went back, and as she came she screamed out her joy, and they were one.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus and Sintikala, spent, complete, slumped against the wall. Even as the shock waves rippled away, he clamped her to him in an iron grip, not wanting the moment to end, never wanting to let her go. Her hands were in his hair, her hips against his, and once again she stared into his eyes as if it were her turn to fill him, pouring her love into him, her intensity, her need.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page241" title="241"/>
<p class="para-p">They gasped a while longer, all the breath knocked out of them. Marcellinus stroked her hair, wiped the slick sweat from her cheeks. Sisika did the same to him.</p>
<p class="para-p">All of a sudden he realized it was very hot. They were bathed in each other’s sweat, but he did not move away, could not. Let their sweat mingle as their blood once had. He would never leave her again.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I love you,” he said in Cahokian and then in Latin.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Alive,” she said throatily, and when she smiled, it melted his heart. “<em class="char-i">Very</em> alive.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes. Alive again, now that I’m with you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She slid off him, still breathing deeply. “I must braid my hair. Now that I no longer mourn.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He reached up, twisted the long black strands around his fingers, tugged her head back. “Not yet,” he said, and kissed her lips, her cheeks, her neck, her breasts. She grabbed his hair, too, pulled him against her even more firmly. Thrust her hips against him, bit his shoulder, and they lost themselves in each other again.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">It was much later, having at last made it the several paces across the room to the bed, that they examined each other more thoroughly. Marcellinus lay still, temporarily exhausted, still sweating. Sintikala climbed over him, roving with eyes and fingers and lips in the light from the smoke hole, learning all the muscles and ridges and scars of his body, the areas rough and smooth. She was gentle now but thorough, and by the time she was done, Marcellinus felt that nobody had ever known him so well.</p>
<p class="para-p">She stepped away then to fetch them water to drink and splash over themselves. Being separated from her for even those moments felt like torture, but gave him the chance to watch her as she walked around her hut lithe and naked. He reveled in every detail of how she moved, confident and sure and proud.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page242" title="242"/>
<p class="para-p">She came back toward him with the bowl of water and paused, aware of his eyes roving over her. She tilted a hip to one side, pretending a coquettishness that was not at all in her nature, and shook her head. He laughed and reached for her.</p>
<p class="para-p">She was still wet from where she had wiped herself down with water and a cloth. Her skin gleamed in the scattered rays of the sunlight, and somehow from the color of those rays Marcellinus realized it was drawing toward evening. He had to make good use of the light.</p>
<p class="para-p">He eased her down onto the bed. She lay there, breathing easily, sipping again at her cup of water, and he knelt over her and began.</p>
<p class="para-p">His exploration of her might have been even more complete and obsessive than hers of him. He felt as if he were memorizing her, blazing every detail of her into his memory, packing her even more deeply into his soul, piece by piece, touch and smell and taste. Soon Sisika began to breathe more heavily under the intensity of his touch, but he persisted, if anything becoming even more gentle, drawing it out until she lay almost in a trance, her eyes staring straight up as she reached her crescendo.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then she pushed herself upright and stared at him with eyes now hooded by the dusk. On hands and knees she crawled toward him, and he lay back and yielded himself up to her slow, gentle fingers and willing lips in return, as night fell over Cahokia.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Hand in hand, barefoot and clad only in tunics, they walked out to meet the dawn. The steelworks was quiet, and the view to the east was clear for once. A fine haze shimmered over the bluffs in the distance. Marcellinus saw the glow from a few cooking fires even this early.</p>
<p class="para-p">They stood and watched the sunrise, saying nothing. Sisika leaned on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I am tired of being a Roman,” he said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Her lips made a moue. “And yet you will always be one.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Truly. But I am tired of fighting. Responsibility. Frayed nerves. Tired of…” He laughed. “Worrying day by day what soldiers will eat and where they’ll sleep. Worrying about tomorrow.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page243" title="243"/>
<p class="para-p">“A pity you brought such a terrible war to us, then,” she said lightly.</p>
<p class="para-p">“The war would have come even had I never lived.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I think it <em class="char-i">may</em> have been a little worse without you,” she said. “Although my legs might not be so sore this morning.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Whose fault is that?” He nudged her affectionately.</p>
<p class="para-p">She grinned and became serious again, all in the same moment. “Gaius, I never want to be apart from you again, but we must be. I never want to be <em class="char-i">not there</em> for you, and yet…I cannot be everywhere.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Then we must fight together,” he said without thinking about it.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala looked dubious. “You will fly?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You above, me below.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She smiled, her hands wandering over his body again, right there out in the open. “You underneath. Yes.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That is not what I meant. But yes, I must be a Roman for a while longer. And you and I must fight the Khan. Together. But…”</p>
<p class="para-p">He looked at her very seriously now, wondering what that would be like. To fight, with the woman he loved also fighting in the battle close by. Sintikala had been airborne during the Battle for Cahokia, of course, and beside him when they had fought the Panther clan, but his feelings for her had multiplied so many times since and were so much more intense today. Would he even be able to think straight? Would he make good decisions?</p>
<p class="para-p">Then again, how good were his decisions in the heat of combat at the best of times?</p>
<p class="para-p">“And after that?” she asked quietly.</p>
<p class="para-p">“After?” Marcellinus shook his head. The coming war loomed so large in his thoughts that it was almost impossible to consider an “after.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We must destroy the Mongols,” Sintikala said. “And then Roma must leave. And we must be just Hesperia, once more.”</p>
<p class="para-p">It felt like an impossible dream.</p>
<p class="para-p">Very quietly, almost whispering it on the morning breeze, Sintikala said: “When Hesperia is free, then Gaius is also free.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page244" title="244"/>
<p class="para-p">“Free.” He tasted the word. “I have never been free, I think. Not ever, in my whole life.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“But now you have something to be free for.” Her fingers entwined with his.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded slowly.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Think about it,” she said. “Not too much. Not so that it slows your sword arm. But think about it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I will,” he said. He stared out at the Great Mound of Cahokia for a few minutes, seeing nothing, and then shook himself as if awakening from sleep a second time and searched for something more mundane to say. “I half expected to see Kimimela still here, waiting for us on the mound’s edge.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Kimimela is flying.” She smiled at him sideways, sensing his change of mood. “We, too, were flying.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He grinned back at her. “Yes, indeed we were.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“She will come to us soon.” Sintikala nodded upward.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sure enough, to the southwest three Catanwakuwa and two Eagles were floating lazily about two thousand feet in the air. “Don’t you ever let your clan sleep?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No. Whenever I am awake, they must be wakeful too.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Then they must be <em class="char-i">really</em> tired this morning.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You are tired? You must be getting old.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Which is odd,” Marcellinus said, “because I feel a great deal younger than I did yesterday.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The five Cahokian aerial craft were doing an odd dance in the sky. “Mock attacks?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Mahkah and the scouts told us of the Mongol flying craft. And so we must practice to bring them down. That and some other new things.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The five wings were coming nearer and lower, and now they split apart in different directions as if their exercise was over. Marcellinus watched the Catanwakuwa soaring, banking, and flying but could not tell which was Kimimela. “Her flying has improved.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“She is my daughter.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“One day she may be better than you.” He glanced left, wondering how she would take that.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page245" title="245"/>
<p class="para-p">“Of course,” Sintikala said readily.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had ignored the two Eagle craft, looking past them at the Hawks, but now one of them swooped down to race between Sintikala’s mound and the Great Mound just a hundred feet away. It banked to come back around. “Ah, this.” Sintikala’s eyes twinkled.</p>
<p class="para-p">“What?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Wait and see.” She patted his chest. “Try not to let your heart stop.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Eagle approached, but it was surely flying too fast to land. Marcellinus watched it agreeably enough…and then, as it buzzed the flat top of Sintikala’s mound at a height of eight feet or so, one of the pilots fell off. “Futete!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela landed lightly on the ground, rolled on her shoulder and back, and came up again. Still moving too quickly to stop herself, she did something in between a cartwheel and a forward somersault, jumped up a second time, and skidded to a halt.</p>
<p class="para-p">Freed of Kimimela’s weight, the Eagle craft lurched upward, almost stalling. The two remaining pilots heaved mightily at their control bars, and the Eagle dipped below the mound top and came up again, gliding more slowly now. It coasted over the palisade wall to land at the base of the Great Mound.</p>
<p class="para-p">Still fifteen feet away, Kimimela pirouetted and then did a formal Roman bow, chuckling. Sintikala released Marcellinus briefly and clapped her hands.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Holy Jove,” Marcellinus said, his heart still in his mouth.</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela ran over and threw her arms around them both. “Gooood morning, lovers!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I <em class="char-i">never</em> want to see you do that again,” Marcellinus said. “Seriously, Kimi. Never. You hear?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Wait till you see what <em class="char-i">else</em>—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No, no, no,” said Marcellinus. “Just <em class="char-i">no—</em>”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala tripped him, kicking his right ankle from under him and shoving, and the three of them collapsed onto the grassy mound top in a pile in something between a hug and a wrestling match.</p>
<p class="para-p">Eventually they rolled apart. “Family breakfast?” Kimimela inquired archly. “I’m sure you two are <em class="char-i">really</em> hungry…”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page246" title="246"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus poked her ribs before she could get out of range, and she squealed and kicked out at him. He parried with his forearm and rolled forward to grab her nose. Sintikala chopped at him to break his grasp. She flipped him over and knelt on his shoulders to pin him to the ground, and Kimimela shoved grass into his mouth.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus laughed, half choking, and spit. He had never been as happy in his entire life as he was in that moment.</p></div></body></html>

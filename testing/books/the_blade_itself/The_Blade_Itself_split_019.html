<div id="filepos511466" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> How Dogs are Trained</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Practical Frost stood by the wall, utterly motionless, utterly silent, barely visible in the deep shadows, a part of the building. The albino hadn’t moved an inch in an hour or more, hadn’t shifted his feet, hadn’t blinked, hadn’t breathed that Glokta had noticed, his eyes fixed on the street before them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta himself cursed, shifted uncomfortably, winced, scratched his face, sucked at his empty gums. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">What’s keeping them? A few minutes more and I might fall asleep, drop into that stinking canal and drown. How very apt that would be.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He watched the oily, smelly water below him flap and ripple. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Body found floating by the docks, bloated by seawater and far, far beyond recognition…</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Frost touched his arm in the darkness, pointed down the street with a big white finger. Three men were moving slowly toward them, walking with the slightly bow-legged stance of men who spend a lot of time aboard ship, keeping their balance on a swaying deck. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">So that’s one half of our little party. Better late than never.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The three sailors came halfway across the bridge over the canal then stopped and waited, no more than twenty strides away. Glokta could hear the tone of their conversation: brash, confident, common accents. He shuffled slightly further into the shadows clinging to the building.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Now footsteps came from the opposite direction, hurried footsteps. Two more men appeared, walking quickly down the street. One, a very tall, thin fellow in an expensive-looking fur coat was glancing suspiciously around him. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">That must be Gofred Hornlach, senior Mercer. Our man.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> His companion had a sword at his hip, and was struggling with a big wooden trunk over one shoulder. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Servant, or bodyguard, or both. He is of no interest.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta felt the hairs on the back of his neck prickling as they neared the bridge. Hornlach exchanged a few quick words with one of the sailors, a man with a big brown beard.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ready?” he whispered to Frost. The Practical nodded.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hold!” shouted Glokta at the top of his voice, “in the name of his Majesty!” Hornlach’s servant spun round, dropping the trunk onto the bridge with a bang, hand moving toward his sword. There was a soft twang from the shadows on the other side of the road. The servant looked surprised, gave a snort, then toppled onto his face. Practical Frost strode swiftly out of the shadows, feet padding on the road.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Hornlach stared down, wide-eyed, at the corpse of his bodyguard, then across at the hulking albino. He turned to the sailors. “Help me!” he cried. “Stop him!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Their leader smiled back. “I don’t think so.” His two companions moved without hurry to block the bridge. The Mercer stumbled away, took a faltering step toward the shadows by the canal on the other side. Severard appeared from a doorway before him, flatbow rested across his shoulder. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Replace the bow with a bunch of flowers and he’d look as if he was on his way to a wedding. You’d never think that he just killed a man.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Surrounded, Hornlach could only look around dumbly, eyes wide with fear and surprise, as the two Practicals approached, Glokta limping up behind them. “But I paid you!” Hornlach shouted desperately at the sailors.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You paid me for a berth,” said their Captain. “Loyalty is extra.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Practical Frost’s big white hand slapped down on the merchant’s shoulder, forced him onto his knees. Severard strolled over to the bodyguard, wedged the dirty toe of his boot under the body and rolled it over. The corpse stared up at the night sky, eyes glassy, the feathers of the flatbow bolt sticking out from his neck. The blood round his mouth looked black in the moonlight.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Dead,” grunted Severard, most unnecessarily.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A bolt through the neck will do that,” said Glokta. “Clean him up, would you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Right you are.” Severard grabbed the bodyguard’s feet and hauled them over the parapet of the bridge, then he took him under the armpits and heaved the body straight over the side with a grunt. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">So smooth, so clean, so practised. You can tell he’s done it before.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> There was a splash as the corpse hit the slimy water below. Frost had Hornlach’s hands tied firmly behind him now, and the bag on. The prisoner squawked through the canvas as he was dragged to his feet. Glokta himself shuffled over to the three sailors, his legs numb after all that time spent standing still in the alley.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And here we are,” he said, pulling a heavy purse from his inside coat pocket. He held it swinging just above the Captain’s waiting palm. “Tell me, what happened tonight?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old sailor smiled, weathered face crinkling up like boot leather. “My cargo was spoiling and we had to be away on the first tide, I told him that. We waited and waited, half the night down by that stinking canal, but would you believe it? The bastard never showed.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Very good. That’s the story I’d tell in Westport, if anyone should ask.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Captain looked hurt. “That’s how it happened, Inquisitor. What other story could there be?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta let the purse drop and the money jingled inside. “With the compliments of his Majesty.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Captain weighed the purse in his hand. “Always pleased to do his Majesty a favour!” And he and his two companions turned, all yellow smiles, and made off toward the quay.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Right then,” said Glokta, “let’s get on with it.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Where are my clothes?” shouted Hornlach, wriggling in his chair.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I do apologise for that. I know it’s quite uncomfortable, but clothes can hide things. Leave a man his clothes and you leave him pride, and dignity, and all kinds of things it’s better not to have in here. I never question a prisoner with their clothes on. Do you remember Salem Rews?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Salem Rews. One of your people. A Mercer. We caught him dodging the King’s taxes. He made a confession, named a few people. I wanted to talk to them, but they all died.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The merchants eyes flickered left and right. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Thinking about his options, trying to guess what we might know.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “People die all the time.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta stared at the painted corpse of Juvens behind his prisoner, bleeding bright red paint all over the wall. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">People die all the time.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Of course, but not quite so violently. I have a notion that someone wanted them dead, that someone ordered them dead. I have a notion it was you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’ve got no proof! No proof! You won’t get away with this!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Proof means nothing, Hornlach, but I’ll indulge you. Rews survived. He’s just down the hall, as it goes, no friends left, blubbering away, naming every Mercer he can think of, or that we can think of, for that matter.” Narrowed eyes, but no reply. “We used him to catch Carpi.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Carpi?” asked the merchant, trying to look nonchalant.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Surely you remember your assassin? Slightly flabby Styrian? Acne scars? Swears a lot? We have him too. He told us the whole story. How you hired him, how much you paid him, what you asked him to do. The whole story.” Glokta smiled. “He has an excellent memory, for a killer, very detailed.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The fear was showing now, just a trace of it, but Hornlach rallied well. “This is an affront to my Guild!” he shouted, with as much authority as he could muster, naked and tied to a chair. “My master, Coster dan Kault, will never allow this, and he’s a close friend of Superior Kalyne!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shit on Kalyne, he’s finished. Besides, Kault thinks you’re tucked up safe aboard that ship, bound for Westport and far beyond our reach. I don’t think you’ll be missed for several weeks.” The merchant’s face had gone slack. “A great deal could happen in that time… a very great deal.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Hornlach’s tongue darted over his lips. He glanced furtively up at Frost and Severard, leaned slightly forward. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">So. Now comes the bargaining.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Inquisitor,” he said in a wheedling tone, “if I’ve learned one thing from life, it’s that every man wants something. Every man has his price, yes? And we have deep pockets. You have only to name it. Only name it! What do you want?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What do I want?” asked Glokta, leaning in to a more conspiratorial distance.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes. What’s this all about? What do you want?” Hornlach was smiling now, a coy, clever little smile. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">How quaint, but you won’t buy your way out of this.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I want my teeth back.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The merchant’s smile began to fade.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I want my leg back.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Hornlach swallowed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I want my life back.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The prisoner had turned very pale.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No? Then perhaps I’ll settle for your head on a stick. You’ve nothing else I want, no matter how deep your pockets are.” Hornlach was trembling slightly now. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">No more bluster? No more deals? Then we can begin.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta picked up the paper in front of him, and read the first question. “What is your name?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Look, Inquisitor, I…” Frost smashed the table with his fist and Hornlach cowered in his chair.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Answer his fucking question!” screamed Severard in his face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gofred Hornlach,” squealed the merchant.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta nodded. “Good. You are a senior member of the Guild of Mercers?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, yes!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“One of Magister Kault’s deputies, in fact?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You know I am!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Have you conspired with other Mercers to defraud his Majesty the King? Did you hire an assassin to wilfully murder ten of his Majesty’s subjects? Were you ordered so to do by Magister Coster dan Kault, the head of the Guild of Mercers?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No!” shouted Hornlach, voice squeaky with panic. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">That is not the answer we need.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta glanced up at Practical Frost. The big white fist sank into the merchants gut, and he gave a gentle sigh and slid sideways.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“My mother keeps dogs, you know,” said Glokta.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Dogs,” hissed Severard in the gasping merchant’s ear, as he shoved him back into the chair.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“She loves them. Trains them to do all manner of tricks.” Glokta pursed his lips. “Do you know how dogs are trained?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Hornlach was still winded, lolling in his chair with watering eyes, some way from being able to speak. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Still at that stage of a fish pulled suddenly from the water. Mouth opening and closing, but no sound.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Repetition,” said Glokta. “Repeat, repeat, repeat. You must have that dog perform his tricks one hundred times the same, and then you must do it all again. It’s all about repetition. And if you want that dog to bark on cue, you mustn’t be shy with the whip. You’re going to bark for me, Hornlach, in front of the Open Council.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re mad,” cried the Mercer, staring around at them, “you’re all mad!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta flashed his empty smile. “If you like. If it helps.” He glanced back at the paper in his hand. “What is your name?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The prisoner swallowed. “Gofred Hornlach.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You are a senior member of the Guild of Mercers?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“One of Magister Kault’s deputies, in fact?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Have you conspired with other Mercers to defraud his Majesty the King? Did you hire an assassin to wilfully murder ten of his Majesty’s subjects? Were you ordered so to do by Magister Coster dan Kault, the head of the Guild of Mercers?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Hornlach cast desperately around him. Frost stared back, Severard stared back.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well?” demanded Glokta.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The merchant closed his eyes. “Yes,” he whimpered.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What’s that?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta smiled. “Excellent. Now tell me. What is your name?”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_19"></div></div></body>

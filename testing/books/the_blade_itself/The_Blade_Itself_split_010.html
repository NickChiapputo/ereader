<div id="filepos193676" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> The Morning Ritual</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was a bright summers day, and the park was filled to capacity with colourful revellers. Colonel Glokta strode manfully toward some meeting of great importance, people bowing and scraping respectfully away to give him room. He ignored most, favoured the more important ones with his brilliant smile. The lucky few beamed back at him, delighted to be noticed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I suppose we all serve the King in our own way,” whined Captain Luthar, reaching for his steel, but Glokta was far too quick for him. His blade flashed with lightning speed, catching the sneering idiot through the neck.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Blood splattered across Ardee West’s face. She clapped her hands in delight, looking at Glokta with shining eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Luthar seemed surprised to be killed. “Hah. Quite so,” said Glokta with a smile. The Captain pitched over onto his face, blood pouring from his punctured throat. The crowd roared their appreciation and Glokta indulged them with a deep, graceful bow. The cheering was redoubled.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, Colonel, you shouldn’t,” murmured Ardee as Glokta licked the blood from her cheek.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shouldn’t what?” he growled, tipping her back in his arms and kissing her fiercely. The crowd were in a frenzy. She gasped as he broke away, looking up at him adoringly with those big dark eyes of hers, lips slightly parted.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Arth Ector wanth you,” she said with a comely smile.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What?” The crowd had fallen silent, damn them, and his left side was turning numb.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ardee touched him tenderly on the cheek. “The Arth Ector!” she shouted.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a heavy knock at the door. Glokta’s eyes flicked open. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Where am I? Who am I?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Oh no.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Oh yes.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He realised straight away he had been sleeping badly, his body was twisted round under the blankets, his face pushed into the pillow. His whole left side was dead.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The beating on the door came heavier than before. “The Arth Ector!” came Frost’s tongueless bellow from the other side.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Pain shot through Glokta’s neck as he tried to raise his head from the pillow. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Ah, there’s nothing like the first spasm of the day to get the mind working.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Alright!” he croaked, “give me a minute, damn it!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The albino’s heavy footsteps thudded away down the corridor. Glokta lay still for a moment, then cautiously moved his right arm, ever so slowly, breath rasping with the effort, and tried to twist himself onto his back. He clenched his fist as the needling started in his left leg. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">If only the damn thing would stay numb.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> But the pain was coming on fast now. He was also becoming aware of an unpleasant smell. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Damn it. I’ve shit myself again.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Barnam!” howled Glokta, then waited, panting, left side throbbing with a vengeance. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Where is the old idiot?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Barnam!” he screamed at the top of his lungs.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Are you alright, sir?” came the servant’s voice from beyond the door.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Alright? Alright, you old fool? Just when do you think I was last alright?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “No, damn it! I’ve soiled the bed!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’ve boiled water for a bath, sir. Can you get up?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Once before Frost had had to break the door down. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Maybe I should let it stand open all night, but then how could I sleep?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “I think I can manage,” Glokta hissed, tongue pressed into his empty gums, arms trembling as he hauled himself out of the bed and onto the chair beside it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">His grotesque, toeless left leg twitched to itself, still beyond his control. He glared down at it with a burning hatred. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Fucking horrible thing. Revolting, useless lump of flesh. Why didn’t they just cut you off? Why don’t I still?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> But he knew why not. With his leg still on he could at least pretend to be half a man. He punched his withered thigh, then immediately regretted it. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Stupid, stupid.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The pain crept up his back, a little more intense than before, and growing with every second. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Come now, come now, let’s not fight.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He started to rub gently at the wasted flesh. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">We are stuck with each other, so why torment me?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Can you get to the door, sir?” Glokta wrinkled his nose at the smell then took hold of his cane and slowly, agonisingly, pushed himself to his feet. He hobbled across the room, almost slipping halfway there but righting himself with a searing twinge. He turned the key in the lock, leaning against the wall for balance, and hauled the door open.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Barnam was standing on the other side, his arms outstretched, ready to catch him. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The ignominy of it. To think that I, Sand dan Glokta, the greatest swordsman the Union has ever seen, must be carried to my bath by an old man so that I can wash my own shit off. They must be laughing loud now, all those fools I beat, if they still remember me. I’d be laughing too, if it didn’t hurt so much.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> But he let the weight off his left leg and put his arm round Barnam’s shoulders without complaint. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">What’s the use after all? Might as well make it easy for myself. As easy as it can be.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta took a deep breath. “Go gently, the leg hasn’t woken up yet.” They hopped and stumbled down the corridor, slightly too narrow for both of them together. The bathroom seemed a mile away. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Or more. I’d rather walk a hundred miles as I used to be, than to the bathroom as I am. But that’s my bad luck isn’t it? You can’t go back. Not ever.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The steam felt deliciously warm on Glokta’s clammy skin. With Barnam holding him under the arms he slowly lifted his right leg and put it gingerly into the water. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Damn it, that’s hot.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The old servant helped him get the other leg in, then, taking him under the armpits, lowered him like a child, until he was immersed up to his neck.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ahhh.” Glokta cracked a toothless smile. “Hot as the Maker’s forge, Barnam, just the way I like it.” The heat was getting into the leg now, and the pain was subsiding. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Not gone. Never gone. But better. A lot better.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta began to feel almost as if he could face another day. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">You have to learn to love the small things in life, like a hot bath. You have to love the small things, when you’ve nothing else.</span></span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Practical Frost was waiting for him downstairs in the tiny dining room, his bulk wedged into a low chair against the wall. Glokta sagged into the other chair and caught a whiff from the steaming porridge bowl, wooden spoon sticking up at an angle without even touching the side. His stomach rumbled and his mouth began watering fiercely. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">All the symptoms, in fact, of extreme nausea.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hurray!” shouted Glokta. “Porridge again!” He looked over at the motionless Practical. “Porridge and honey, better than money, everything’s funny, with porridge and honey!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The pink eyes did not blink.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It’s a rhyme for children. My mother used to sing it to me. Never actually got me to eat this slop though. But now,” and he dug the spoon in, “I can’t get enough of it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Frost stared back at him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Healthy,” said Glokta, forcing down a mouthful of sweet mush and spooning up another, “delicious,” choking down some more, “and here’s the real clincher,” he gagged slightly on the next swallow, “no chewing required.” He shoved the mostly full bowl away and tossed the spoon after it. “Mmmmm,” he hummed. “A good breakfast makes for a good day, don’t you find?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was like staring at a whitewashed wall, but without all the emotion.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So the Arch Lector wants me again, does he?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The albino nodded.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And what might our illustrious leader desire with the likes of us, do you think?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A shrug.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hmmm.” Glokta licked bits of porridge out of his empty gums. “Does he seem in a good mood, do you know?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Another shrug.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Come, come, Practical Frost, don’t tell me everything at once, I can’t take it in.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Silence. Barnam entered the room and cleared away the bowl. “Do you want anything else, sir?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Absolutely. A big half-raw slab of meat and a nice crunchy apple.” He looked over at Practical Frost. “I used to love apples when I was a child.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">How many times have I made that joke?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Frost looked back impassively, there was no laughter there. Glokta turned to Barnam, and the old man gave a tired smile.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh well,” sighed Glokta. A man has to have hope doesn’t he?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course sir,” muttered the servant, heading for the door.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Does he?</span></span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector’s office was on the top floor of the House of Questions, and it was a long way up. Worse still, the corridors were busy with people. Practicals, clerks, Inquisitors, crawling like ants through a crumbling dung-hill. Whenever he felt their eyes on him Glokta would limp along, smiling, head held high. Whenever he felt himself alone he would pause and gasp, sweat and curse, and rub and slap the tenuous life back into his leg.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Why does it have to be so high?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> he asked himself as he shuffled up the dim halls and winding stairs of the labyrinthine building. By the time he reached the antechamber he was exhausted and blowing hard, left hand sore on the handle of his cane.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector’s secretary examined him suspiciously from behind a big dark desk that took up half the room. There were some chairs placed opposite for people to get nervous waiting in, and two huge Practicals flanked the great double doors to the office, so still and grim as to appear a part of the furniture.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Do you have an appointment?” demanded the secretary in a shrill voice. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">You know who I am, you self-important little shit.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course,” snapped Glokta, “do you think I limped all the way up here to admire your desk?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The secretary looked down his nose at him. He was a pale, handsome young man with a mop of yellow hair. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The puffed up fifth son of some minor nobleman with over-active loins, and he thinks he can patronise me?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “And your name is?” he asked with a sneer.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta’s patience was worn out by the climb. He smashed his cane down on the top of the desk and the secretary near jumped out of his chair. “What are you? A fucking idiot? How many crippled Inquisitors do you have here?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Er…” said the secretary, mouth working nervously.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Er? Er? Is that a number? Speak up!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well I—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m Glokta, you dolt! Inquisitor Glokta!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, sir, I—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Get your fat arse out of that chair, fool! Don’t keep me waiting!” The secretary sprang up, hurried to the doors, pushed one open and stood aside respectfully. “That’s better,” growled Glokta, shuffling after him. He looked up at the Practicals as he hobbled past. He was almost sure one of them had a slight smile on his face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The room had hardly changed since he was last there, six years before. It was a cavernous, round space, domed ceiling carved with gargoyle faces, its one enormous window offering a spectacular view over the spires of the University, a great section of the outer wall of the Agriont, and the looming outline of the House of the Maker beyond.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The chamber was mostly lined with shelves and cabinets, stacked high with neatly ordered files and papers. A few dark portraits peered down from the sparse white walls, including a huge one of the current King of the Union as a young man, looking wise and stern. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">No doubt painted before he became a senile joke. These days there’s usually a bit less authority and a bit more stray drool about him.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> There was a heavy round table in the centre of the room, its surface painted with a map of the Union in exquisite detail. Every city in which there was a department of the Inquisition was marked with a precious stone, and a tiny silver replica of Adua rose out of the table at its hub.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector was sitting in an ancient high chair at this table, deep in conversation with another man: a gaunt, balding, sour-faced old fellow in dark robes. Sult beamed up as Glokta shuffled towards them, the other man’s expression hardly changed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Why, Inquisitor Glokta, delighted you could join us. Do you know Surveyor General Halleck?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I have not had the pleasure,” said Glokta. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Not that it looks like much of a pleasure, though.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The old bureaucrat stood and shook Glokta’s hand without enthusiasm.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And this is one of my Inquisitors, Sand dan Glokta.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes indeed,” murmured Halleck. “You used to be in the army, I believe. I saw you fence once.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta tapped his leg with his cane. “That can’t have been any time recently.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No.” There was a silence.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Surveyor General is likely soon to receive a most significant promotion,” said Sult. “To a chair on the Closed Council itself.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The Closed Council? Indeed? A most significant promotion.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Halleck seemed less than delighted, however. “I will consider it done when it is his Majesty’s pleasure to invite me,” he snapped, “and not before.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sult floated smoothly over this rocky ground. “I am sure the Council feels that you are the only candidate worth recommending, now that Sepp dan Teufel is no longer being considered.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Our old friend Teufel? No longer considered for what?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Halleck frowned and shook his head. “Teufel. I worked with the man for ten years. I never liked him,” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">or anyone else, by the look of you,</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “but I would never have thought him a traitor.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sult shook his head sadly. “We all feel it keenly, but here is his confession in black and white.” He held up the folded paper with a doleful frown. “I fear the roots of corruption can run very deep. Who would know that better than I, whose sorry task it is to weed the garden?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Indeed, indeed,” muttered Halleck, nodding grimly. “You deserve all of our thanks for that. You also, Inquisitor.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh no, not I,” said Glokta humbly. The three men looked at each other in a sham of mutual respect.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Halleck pushed back his chair. “Well, taxes do not collect themselves. I must return to my work.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Enjoy your last few days in the job,” said Sult. “I give you my word that the King will send for you soon!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Halleck allowed himself the thinnest of smiles, then nodded stiffly to them and stalked away. The secretary ushered him out and pulled the heavy door shut. There was silence. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But I’m damned if I’ll be the one to break it.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I expect you’re wondering what this was all about, eh, Glokta?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The thought had crossed my mind, your Eminence.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I bet it had.” Sult swept from his chair and strode across to the window, his white-gloved hands clasped behind his back. “The world changes, Glokta, the world changes. The old order crumbles. Loyalty, duty, pride, honour. Notions that have fallen far from fashion. What has replaced them?” He glanced over his shoulder for a moment, and his lip curled. “Greed. Merchants have become the new power in the land. Bankers, shopkeepers, salesmen. Little men, with little minds and little ambitions. Men whose only loyalty is to themselves, whose only duty is to their own purses, whose only pride is in swindling their betters, whose only honour is weighed out in silver coin.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">No need to ask where you stand on the merchant class.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sult scowled out at the view, then turned back into the room. “Now it seems anyone’s son can get an education, and a business, and become rich. The merchant guilds: the Mercers, the Spicers and their like, grow steadily in wealth and influence. Jumped-up, posturing commoners dictating to their natural betters. Their fat and greedy fingers, fumbling at the strings of power. It is almost too much to stand.” He gave a shudder as he paced across the floor.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I will speak honestly with you, Inquisitor.” The Arch Lector waved his graceful hand as though his honesty were a priceless gift. “The Union has never seemed more powerful, has never controlled more land, but beneath the façade we are weak. It is hardly a secret that the King has become entirely unable to make his own decisions. Crown Prince Ladisla is a fop, surrounded by flatterers and fools, caring for nothing but gambling and clothes. Prince Raynault is far better fitted to rule, but he is the younger brother. The Closed Council, whose task it should be to steer this leaking vessel, is packed with frauds and schemers. Some may be loyal, some are definitely not, each intent on pulling the King his own way.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">How frustrating, when I suppose they should all be pulling him in yours?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Meanwhile, the Union is beset with enemies, dangers outside our borders, and dangers within. Gurkhul has a new and vigorous Emperor, fitting his country for another war. The Northmen are up in arms as well, skulking on the borders of Angland. In the Open Council the noblemen clamour for ancient rights, while in the villages the peasants clamour for new ones.” He gave a deep sigh. “Yes, the old order crumbles, and no one has the heart or the stomach to support it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sult paused, staring up at one of the portraits: a hefty, bald man dressed all in white. Glokta recognised him well enough. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Zoller, the greatest of all Arch Lectors. Tireless champion of the Inquisition, hero to the torturer, scourge of the disloyal.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He glared down balefully from the wall, as though even beyond death he could burn traitors with a glance.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Zoller,” growled Sult. “Things were different in his day, I can tell you. No whinging peasants then, no swindling merchants, no sulking noblemen. If men forgot their place they were reminded with hot iron, and any carping judge who dared to whine about it was never heard from again. The Inquisition was a noble institution, filled with the best and the brightest. To serve their King and to root out disloyalty were their only desires, and their only rewards.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Oh, things were grand in the old days.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector slid back into his seat and leaned forward across the table. “Now we have become a place where third sons of impoverished noblemen can line their pockets with bribes, or where near-criminal scum can indulge a passion for torture. Our influence with the King has been steadily eroded, our budgets have been steadily cut. Once we were feared and respected, Glokta, but now…” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">We’re a miserable sham.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Sult frowned, “Well, less so. Intrigues and treasons abound, and I fear that the Inquisition is no longer equal to its task. Too many of the Superiors can no longer be trusted. They are no longer concerned with the interests of the King, or of the state, or of anybody’s interests beyond their own.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The Superiors? Not to be trusted? I swoon with the shock.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Sult’s frown grew still deeper. “And now Feekt is dead.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta looked up. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Now that is news.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “The Lord Chancellor?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It will become public knowledge tomorrow morning. He died suddenly a few nights ago, while you were busy with your friend Rews. There are still some questions surrounding his death, but the man was nearly ninety. The surprise is that he lasted this long. The golden Chancellor they called him, the greatest politician of his day. Even now they are setting his likeness in stone, for a statue on the Kingsway.” Sult snorted to himself. “The greatest gift that any of us can hope for.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector’s eyes narrowed to blue slits. “If you have any childish notions that the Union is controlled by its King, or by those prating blue-blood fools on the Open Council, you can let them wilt now. The Closed Council is where the power lies. More than ever since the King’s illness. Twelve men, in twelve big, uncomfortable chairs, myself among them. Twelve men with very different ideas, and for twenty years, war and peace, Feekt held us in balance. He played off the Inquisition against the judges, the bankers against the military. He was the axle on which the Kingdom turned, the foundation on which it rested, and his death has left a hole. All kinds of gaping holes, and people will be rushing to fill them. I have a feeling that whining ass Marovia, that bleeding heart of a High Justice, that self-appointed champion of the common man, will be first in the queue. It is a fluid, and a dangerous, situation.” The Arch Lector planted his fists firmly on the table before him. “We must ensure that the wrong people do not take advantage of it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta nodded. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I think I take your meaning, Arch Lector. We must ensure that it is we who take advantage, and no one else.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It need hardly be said that the post of Lord Chancellor is one of the most powerful in the realm. The gathering of taxes, the treasury, the King’s mints, all come under his auspices. Money, Glokta, money. And money is power, I need hardly tell you. A new Chancellor will be appointed tomorrow. The foremost candidate was our erstwhile Master of the Mints, Sepp dan Teufel.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I see. Something tells me he will no longer be under consideration.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sult’s lip curled. “Teufel was closely linked with the merchant guilds, and the Mercers in particular.” His sneer became a scowl. “In addition to which he was an associate of High Justice Marovia. So, you see, he would hardly have made a suitable Lord Chancellor.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">No indeed. Hardly suitable.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Surveyor General Halleck is a far better choice, in my opinion.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta looked towards the door. “Him? Lord Chancellor?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sult got up smiling and moved over to a cabinet against the wall. “There really is no one else. Everyone hates him, and he hates everyone, except me. Furthermore, he is a hard-nosed conservative, who despises the merchant class and everything they stand for.” He opened the cabinet and took out two glasses and an ornate decanter. “If not exactly a friendly face on the Council, he will at least be a sympathetic one, and damned hostile toward everyone else. I can hardly think of a more suitable candidate.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta nodded. “He seems honest.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But not so honest that I’d trust him to put me in the bath. Would you, your Eminence?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes,” said Sult, “he will be very valuable to us.” He poured out two glasses of rich red wine. “And just as a bonus, I was able to arrange for a sympathetic new Master of the Mints as well. I hear that the Mercers are absolutely biting their tongues off with fury. Marovia’s none too happy either, the bastard.” Sult chuckled to himself. “All good news, and we have you to thank.” He held out one of the glasses.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Poison? A slow death twitching and puking on the Arch Lectors lovely mosaic floor? Or just pitching onto my face on his table?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> But there was really no option but to grasp the glass and take a hearty swig. The wine was unfamiliar but delicious. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Probably from somewhere very beautiful and far away. At least if I die up here I wont have to make it back down all those steps.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> But the Arch Lector was drinking too, all smiles and good grace. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">So I suppose I will last out the afternoon, after all.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, we have made a good first step. These are dangerous times alright, and yet danger and opportunity often walk hand in hand.” Glokta felt a strange sensation creeping up his back. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Is that fear, or ambition, or both?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “I need someone to help me put matters in order. Someone who does not fear the Superiors, or the merchants, or even the Closed Council. Someone who can be relied upon to act with subtlety, and discretion, and ruthlessness. Someone whose loyalty to the Union is beyond question, but who has no friends within the government.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Someone who’s hated by everyone? Someone to take the fall if things turn sour? Someone who will have few mourners at their funeral?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I have need of an Inquisitor Exempt, Glokta. Someone to operate beyond the Superiors’ control, but with my full authority. Someone answerable only to me.” The Arch Lector raised an eyebrow, as though the thought had only just come to him. “It strikes me that you are exceptionally well suited to this task. What do you think?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I think the holder of such a post would have a great many enemies and only one friend.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta peered up at the Arch Lector. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And that friend might not be so very reliable. I think the holder of such a post might not last long.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Could I have some time to consider it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Danger and opportunity often walk hand in hand…</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Then I accept.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Excellent. I do believe this is the start of a long and productive relationship.” Sult smiled at him over the rim of his glass. “You know, Glokta, of all the merchants grubbing away out there, it is the Mercers I find the most unpalatable. It was largely through their influence that Westport entered the Union, and it was because of Westport’s money that we won the Gurkish war. The King rewarded them, of course, with priceless trading rights, but ever since then their arrogance has been insufferable. Anyone would have thought they fought the battles themselves, for the airs they have put on, and the liberties they have taken. The honourable Guild of Mercers,” he sneered. “It occurs to me, now that your friend Rews has given us the means to hook them in so deeply, it would be a shame to let them wriggle free.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta was much surprised, though he thought he hid it well. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">To go further? Why? The Mercers wriggle free and they keep on paying, and that keeps all kinds of people happy. As things are, they’re scared and soft—wondering who Rews named, who might be next in the chair. If we go further they may be hurt, or finished entirely. Then they’ll stop paying, and a lot of people will be unhappy. Some of them in this very building.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “I can easily continue my investigations, your Eminence, if you would like me to.” Glokta took another sip. It really was an excellent wine.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We must be cautious. Cautious and very thorough. The Mercers’ money flows like milk. They have many friends, even amongst the highest circles of the nobility. Brock, Heugen, Isher, and plenty more besides. Some of the very greatest men in the land. They’ve all been known to suck at that tit, one time or another, and babies will cry when their milk is snatched away.” A cruel grin flickered across Sult’s face. “But still, if children are to learn discipline, they must sometimes be made to weep… who did that worm Rews name in his confession?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta leaned forward painfully and slid Rews’ paper of confession toward him, unfolded it and scanned the list of names from bottom to top.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Sepp dan Teufel, we all know.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, we know and love him, Inquisitor,” said Sult, beaming down, “but I feel we may safely cross him off the list. Who else?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, let’s see,” Glokta took a leisurely look back at the paper. “There’s Harod Polst, a Mercer.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A nobody.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sult waved his hand impatiently. “He’s nobody.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Solimo Scandi, a Mercer from Westport.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Also nobody.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No, no, Glokta, we can do better than Solimo what’s-his-name can’t we? These little Mercers are of no real interest. Pull up the root, and the leaves die by themselves.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Quite so, Arch Lector. We have Villem dan Robb, minor nobility, holds a junior customs post.” Sult looked thoughtful, shook his head. “Then there’s—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Wait! Villem dan Robb…” The Arch Lector snapped his fingers, “His brother Kiral is one of the Queen’s gentlemen. He snubbed me at a social gathering.” Sult smiled. “Yes, Villem dan Robb, bring him in.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And so we go deeper.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “I serve and obey, your Eminence. Is there anyone’s name in particular that need be mentioned?” Glokta set down his empty glass.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No.” The Arch Lector turned away and waved his hand again. “Any of ’em, all of ’em. I don’t care.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_10"></div></div></body>

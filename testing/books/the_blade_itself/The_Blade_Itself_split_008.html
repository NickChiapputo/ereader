<div id="filepos131359" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> The Wide and Barren North</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Magi are an ancient and mysterious order, learned in the secrets of the world, practised in the ways of magic, wise and powerful beyond the dreams of men. That was the rumour. Such a one should have ways of finding a man, even a man alone in the wide and barren North. If that was so, then he was taking his time about it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen scratched at his tangled beard and wondered what was keeping the great one. Perhaps he was lost. He asked himself again if he should have stayed in the forests, where food at least was plentiful. But to the south the spirits had said, and if you went south from the hills you came to these withered moors. So here he had waited in the briars and the mud, in bad weather, and mostly gone hungry.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">His boots were worn out anyway, so he had set his miserable camp not far from the road, the better to see this wizard coming. Since the wars, the North was full of dangerous scum—deserting warriors turned bandit, peasants fled from their burned-out land, leaderless and desperate men with nothing left to lose, and so on. Logen wasn’t worried, though. No one had a reason to come to this arsehole of the world. No one but him and the Magus.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">So he sat and waited, looked for food, didn’t find any, sat and waited some more. At this time of year the moors were often soaked by sudden downpours, but he would have smoky, thorny little fires by night if he could, to keep his flagging spirits up and attract any passing wizards. It had been raining this evening, but it had stopped a while before and it was dry enough for a fire. Now he had his pot over it, cooking a stew with the last of the meat he had brought with him from the forest. He would have to move on in the morning, and look for food. The Magus could catch up with him later, if he still cared.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was stirring his meagre meal, and wondering whether to go back north or move on south tomorrow, when he heard the sound of hooves on the road. One horse, moving slowly. He sat back on his coat and waited. There was a neigh, the jingle of a harness. A rider came over the rise. With the watery sun low on the horizon behind, Logen couldn’t see him clearly, but he sat stiff and awkward in his saddle, like a man not used to the road. He urged his horse gently in the direction of the fire and reined in a few yards away.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good evening,” he said.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was not in the least what Logen had been expecting. A gaunt, pale, sickly-looking young man with dark rings round his eyes, long hair plastered to his head by the drizzle and a nervous smile. He seemed more wet than wise, and certainly didn’t look powerful beyond the dreams of men. He looked mostly hungry, cold, and ill. He looked something like Logen felt, in fact.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shouldn’t you have a staff?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The young man looked surprised. “I don’t… that is to say… er… I’m not a Magus.” He trailed off and licked his lips nervously.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The spirits told me to expect a Magus, but they’re often wrong.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh… well, I’m an apprentice. But my Master, the great Bayaz,” and he bowed his head reverently, “is none other than the First of the Magi, great in High Art and learned in deep wisdom. He sent me to find you,” he looked suddenly doubtful, “and bring you… you are Logen Ninefingers?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen held up his left hand and looked at the pale young man through the gap where his middle finger used to be. “Oh good.” The apprentice breathed a sigh of relief, then suddenly stopped himself. “Oh, that is to say… er… sorry about the finger.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen laughed. It was the first time since he dragged himself out of the river. It wasn’t very funny but he laughed loud. It felt good. The young man smiled and slipped painfully from the saddle. “I am Malacus Quai.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Malacus what?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Quai,” he said, making for the fire.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What kind of a name is that?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I am from the Old Empire.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen had never heard of any such place. “An empire, eh?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, it was, once. The mightiest nation in the Circle of the World.” The young man squatted down stiffly by the fire. “But the glory of the past is long faded. It’s not much more than a huge battlefield now.” Logen nodded. He knew well enough what one of those looked like. “It’s far away. In the west of the world.” The apprentice waved his hand vaguely.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen laughed again. “That’s east.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Quai smiled sadly. “I am a seer, though not, it seems, a very good one. Master Bayaz sent me to find you, but the stars have not been auspicious and I became lost in the bad weather.” He pushed his hair out of his eyes and spread his hands. “I had a packhorse, with food and supplies, and another horse for you, but I lost them in a storm. I fear I am no outdoorsman.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Seems not.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Quai took a flask from his pocket and leaned across with it. Logen took it from him, opened it, took a swig. The hot liquor ran down his throat, warmed him to the roots of his hair. “Well, Malacus Quai, you lost your food but you kept hold of what really mattered. It takes an effort to make me smile these days. You’re right welcome at my fire.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Thank you.” The apprentice paused and held his palms out to the meagre flames. “I haven’t eaten for two days.” He shook his head, hair flapping back and forth. “It has been… a difficult time.” He licked his lips and looked at the pot.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen passed him the spoon. Malacus Quai stared at it with big round eyes. “Have you eaten?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen nodded. He hadn’t, but the wretched apprentice looked famished and there was barely enough for one. He took another swig from the flask. That would do for him, for now. Quai attacked the stew with relish. When it was done he scraped the pot out, licked the spoon, then licked the edge of the pot for good measure. He sat back against a big rock. “I am forever in your debt, Logen Ninefingers, you’ve saved my life. I hardly dared hope you’d be so gracious a host.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re not quite what I expected either, being honest.” Logen pulled at the flask again, and licked his lips. “Who is this Bayaz?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The First of the Magi, great in High Art and learned in deep wisdom. I fear he will be most seriously displeased with me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He’s to be feared, then?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well,” replied the apprentice weakly, “he does have a bit of a temper.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen took another swallow. The warmth was spreading through his body now, the first time he had felt warm in weeks. There was a pause. “What does he want from me, Quai?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was no reply. The soft sound of snoring came from across the fire. Logen smiled and, wrapping himself in his coat, lay down to sleep as well.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The apprentice woke with a sudden fit of coughing. It was early morning and the dingy world was thick with mist. It was probably better that way. There was nothing to see but miles of mud, rock, and miserable brown gorse. Everything was coated in cold dew, but Logen had managed to get a sad tongue of fire going. Quai’s hair was plastered to his pallid face. He rolled onto his side and coughed phlegm onto the ground.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Aaargh,” he croaked. He coughed and spat again.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen secured the last of his meagre gear on the unhappy horse. “Morning,” he said, looking up at the white sky, “though not a good one.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I will die. I will die, and then I will not have to move.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We’ve got no food, so if we stay here you will die. Then I can eat you and go back over the mountains.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The apprentice smiled weakly. “What do we do?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">What indeed? “Where do we find this Bayaz?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“At the Great Northern Library.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen had never heard of it, but then he’d never been that interested in books. “Which is where?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It’s south of here, about four days’ ride, beside a great lake.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Do you know the way?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The apprentice tottered to his feet and stood, swaying slightly, breathing fast and shallow. He was ghostly pale and his face had a sheen of sweat. “I think so,” he muttered, but he hardly looked certain.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Neither Quai nor his horse would make four days without food, even providing they didn’t get lost. Food had to be the first thing. To follow the road through the woods to the south was the best option, despite the greater risk. They might get killed by bandits, but the forage would be better, and the hunger would likely kill them otherwise.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’d better ride,” said Logen.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I lost the horses, I should be the one to walk.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen put his hand on Quai’s forehead. It was hot and clammy. “You’ve a fever. You’d better ride.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The apprentice didn’t try to argue. He looked down at Logen’s ragged boots. “Can you take my boots?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen shook his head. “Too small.” He knelt down over the smouldering remains of the fire and pursed his lips.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What are you doing?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Fires have spirits. I will keep this one under my tongue, and we can use it to light another fire later.” Quai looked too ill to be surprised. Logen sucked up the spirit, coughed on the smoke, shuddered at the bitter taste. “You ready to leave?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The apprentice raised his arms in a hopeless gesture. “I am packed.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Malacus Quai loved to talk. He talked as they made their way south across the moors, as the sun climbed into the grimy skies, as they entered the woods toward evening time. His illness did nothing to stop his chatter, but Logen didn’t mind. It was a long time since anyone had talked to him, and it helped to take his mind off his feet. He was starving and tired, but it was his feet that were the problem. His boots were tatters of old leather, his toes cut and battered, his calf was still burning from the Shanka’s teeth. Every step was an ordeal. Once they had called him the most feared man in the North. Now he was afraid of the smallest sticks and stones in the road. There was a joke in there somewhere. He winced as his foot hit a pebble.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“…so I spent seven years studying with Master Zacharus. He is great among the Magi, the fifth of Juvens’ twelve apprentices, a great man.” Everything connected with the Magi seemed to be great in Quai’s eyes. “He felt I was ready to come to the Great Northern Library and study with Master Bayaz, to earn my staff. But things have not been easy for me here. Master Bayaz is most demanding and…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The horse stopped and snorted, shied and took a hesitant step back. Logen sniffed the air and frowned. There were men nearby, and badly washed ones. He should have noticed it sooner but his attention had been on his feet. Quai looked down at him. “What is it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">As if in answer a man stepped out from behind a tree perhaps ten strides ahead, another a little further down the road. They were scum, without a doubt. Dirty, bearded, dressed in ragged bits of mismatched fur and leather. Not, on the whole, unlike Logen. The skinny one on the left had a spear with a barbed head. The big one on the right had a heavy sword speckled with rust, and an old dented helmet with a spike on top. They moved forward, grinning. There was a sound behind and Logen looked over his shoulder, his heart sinking. A third man, with a big boil on his face, was making his way cautiously down the road toward them, a heavy wood axe in his hands.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Quai leaned down from his saddle, eyes wide with fear. “Are they bandits?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re the fucking seer,” hissed Logen through gritted teeth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They stopped a stride or two in front. The one with the helmet seemed to be in charge. “Nice horse,” he growled. “Would you lend it to us?” The one with the spear grinned as he took hold of the bridle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Things had taken a turn for the worse alright. A moment ago that had hardly seemed possible, but fate had found a way. Logen doubted that Quai would be much use in a fight. That left him alone against three or more, and with only a knife. If he did nothing him and Malacus would end up robbed, and more than likely killed. You have to be realistic about these things.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He looked the three bandits over again. They didn’t expect a fight, not from two unarmed men—the spear was sideways on, the sword pointed at the ground. He didn’t know about the axe, so he’d have to trust to luck with that one. It’s a sorry fact that the man who strikes first usually strikes last, so Logen turned to the one with the helmet and spat the spirit in his face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It ignited in the air and pounced on him hungrily. His head burst into spitting flames, the sword clattered to the ground. He clawed desperately at his face and his arms caught fire as well. He reeled screaming away.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Quai’s horse startled at the flames and reared up, snorting. The skinny man stumbled back with a gasp and Logen leaped at him, grabbed the shaft of the spear with one hand and butted him in the face. His nose crunched against Logen’s forehead and he staggered away with blood streaming down his chin. Logen jerked him back with the spear, swung his right arm round in a wide arc and punched him in the neck. He went down with a gurgle and Logen tore the spear from his hands.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He felt movement behind him and dropped to the ground, rolling away to his left. The axe whistled through the air above his head and cut a long slash in the horse’s side, spattering drops of blood across the ground and ripping the buckle on the saddle girth open. Boil-face tottered away, spinning around after his axe. Logen sprang at him but his ankle twisted on a stone and he tottered like a drunkard, yelping at the pain. An arrow hummed past his face from somewhere in the trees behind and was lost in the bushes on the other side of the road. The horse snorted and kicked, eyes rolling madly, then took off down the road at a crazy gallop. Malacus Quai wailed as the saddle slid off its back and he was flung into the bushes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was no time to think about him. Logen charged at the axe-man with a roar, aiming the spear at his heart. He brought his axe up in time to nudge the point away, but not far enough. The spear spitted him through the shoulder, spun him round. There was a sharp crack as the shaft snapped, Logen lost his balance and pitched forward, bearing Boil-face down into the road. The spear-point sticking out of his back cut a deep gash into Logen’s scalp as he fell on top of him. Logen seized hold of the axe-man’s matted hair with both hands, pulled his head back and mashed his face into a rock.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He lurched to his feet, head spinning, wiping blood out of his eyes just in time to see an arrow zip out of the trees and thud into a trunk a stride or two away. Logen hurtled at the archer. He saw him now, a boy no more than fourteen, reaching for another arrow. Logen pulled out his knife. The boy was nocking the arrow to his bow, but his eyes were wide with panic. He fumbled the string and drove the arrow through his hand, looking greatly surprised.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen was on him. The boy swung the bow at him but he ducked below it and jumped forward, driving the knife up with both hands. The blade caught the boy under the chin and lifted him into the air, then snapped off in his neck. He dropped on top of Logen, the jagged shard of the knife cutting a long gash in his arm. Blood splattered everywhere, from the cut on Logen’s head, from the cut on Logen’s arm, from the gaping wound in the boy’s throat.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He shoved the corpse away, staggered against a tree and gasped for breath. His heart was pounding, the blood roaring in his ears, his stomach turning over. “I am still alive,” he whispered, “I am still alive.” The cuts on his head and his arm were starting to throb. Two more scars. It could have been a lot worse. He scraped the blood from his eyes and limped back to the road.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Malacus Quai was standing, staring ashen-faced at the three corpses. Logen took him by the shoulders, looked him up and down. “You hurt?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Quai only stared at the bodies. “Are they dead?” The corpse of the big one with the helmet was still smoking, making a disgustingly appetising smell. He had a good pair of boots on, Logen noticed, a lot better than his own. The one with the boil had his neck turned too far around to be alive, that and he had the broken spear through him. Logen rolled the skinny one over with his foot. He still had a look of surprise on his bloody face, eyes staring up at the sky, mouth open.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Must’ve crushed his windpipe,” muttered Logen. His hands were covered in blood. He grabbed one with the other to stop them from trembling.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What about the one in the trees?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen nodded. “What happened to the horse?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gone,” muttered Quai hopelessly. “What do we do?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We see if they’ve got any food.” Logen pointed to the smoking corpse. “And you help me get his boots off.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_8"></div></div></body>

<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">I</span>t was their last evening on the Wemissori. The next day, the leading ships in the Roman fleet would arrive back in Cahokia.</p>
<p class="para-p">The galleys did not sail the river by night. The risk of holing a ship on a submerged tree trunk or rock, running aground, or sticking firmly in the river mud was too great. Even if night travel had been safe, the vessels were so crowded with Romans and Hesperians and their weaponry and supplies that there was no room for everyone to lie down. Instead they moored along the bank at dusk, and the Roman cohorts threw up makeshift field fortifications in a line parallel to the shore: a shallow berm studded with sharpened stakes, with a deep ditch beyond it. The Hesperians politely asked whom the Romans were protecting themselves against—they were at peace with the Iroqua, Blackfoot, People of the Hand, and the other tribes that had departed from Forward Camp days before, presumably heading back to their homelands, and the Mongols were even farther away and still making haste westward—but old Roman habits died hard, and no tribune or centurion would allow his men to sleep unprotected.</p>
<p class="para-p">It might have been better for Hadrianus to have remained in his stateroom on board the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>, but he would not hear of it: as Imperator, he slept among his men. And so his Praetorians had carried him ashore on his litter and installed him in his Praetorium tent, where he sat up and dined with Marcellinus, Agrippa, and the lead tribunes of his three war-battered legions, with his Greek medicus flickering around behind him like a fussy ghost.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page469" title="469"/>
<p class="para-p">After dinner Marcellinus went to stand outside the tent, looking out across the Wemissori past the great warships that loomed along the bank.</p>
<p class="para-p">Cahokia was near, and Marcellinus was craving their first view of the Great City. Approaching from the north, they would first see the Circle of the Cedars poking up over the tree line and then the longhouses on top of the Master Mound, all wreathed in the smoke that rose from the hearth fires of the city.</p>
<p class="para-p">He would be home, but Sintikala would not. The ships of the Roman fleet were spread out along the Wemissori. The <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>, the <em class="char-i">Clementia</em>, and the smaller ships of Roma and Cahokia had left first with the Imperator, the wounded, and as many other legionaries as they could take. Loading the <em class="char-i">Minerva</em> and the <em class="char-i">Fides</em> with the Hawk, Eagle, and Thunderbird craft had been a task left for last, as it was more careful work that could be achieved more readily once almost everyone else was out of the way. It might be two or three days before Marcellinus would see Sintikala and Kimimela again, and he was less than happy about that.</p>
<p class="para-p">Not that he had much time at leisure. These were his last days as a Praetor, and his pride was driving him to do all he could to ensure that he was leaving the Sixth Ferrata—his last ever Roman command—in as organized a shape as possible…</p>
<p class="para-p">He shook himself, dismissing such woolgathering. There was serious work to be done tonight. The imminent meeting between Tahtay and the Imperator would be critical for Cahokia, for Roma, and for Marcellinus himself.</p>
<p class="para-p">Yet despite the risks that might lie ahead, Marcellinus found that he was looking forward to it. He wanted all this to be over.</p>
<p class="para-p">Soon he saw the war chief threading his way between the Roman campfires toward him. As Tahtay arrived in front of the Praetorium tent, neither of them said a word. They hardly needed to.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay nodded to Marcellinus. Marcellinus nodded back. Then the Imperator’s Praetorians pulled the tent flaps aside, and the two of them walked into the presence of the Imperator.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page470" title="470"/>
<p class="para-p">“Ah, Tahtay.” The Imperator raised a hand in greeting, then allowed it to fall back down beside him. Even at that easy movement, his medicus frowned. “Forgive me for not arising to greet you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You look better, Caesar,” Tahtay said courteously.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I…” The Imperator coughed, and his face creased in sudden pain. They waited patiently for him to recover. “I offer you wine, although I am afraid I am not permitted to join you just yet.” He tilted his head, indicating the medicus, who sighed.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Not tonight, sir,” Tahtay said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Then sit, sit.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus did so, but Tahtay remained standing. “Tomorrow we will be back in Cahokia,” he said. “And so tonight we must speak of the future of the great alliance between Roma and the Hesperian League. We would not want any mistakes or misunderstandings at this late date, after our friendship has survived so much.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay’s expression and tone were pleasant enough, but Marcellinus knew the war chief well enough to see the iron resolve that lay beneath them and the restless energy that churned within him.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You and I, Caesar, we swore a blood oath,” Tahtay continued. “We vowed to do everything in our power to help each other destroy the Mongols. That, we have done. That slate is clean. Our debt of war is paid. Is it not so?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator stirred painfully, but his voice was as strong as ever. “It is so, Tahtay.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And so, when we arrive in Cahokia, what then? What next?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus half smiled. “Then, of course, my army must be resupplied. You promised me corn, Tahtay, and my legions will require all the corn in your granaries. In a month or so you will harvest new corn from your fields to replace it, no? And we will also need beans, askutasquash, and whatever dried fish and meat you can spare for our journey.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Your journey home, Caesar? Out of Cahokia, then, and back to your own land?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page471" title="471"/>
<p class="para-p">“Yes,” Hadrianus said. “Back to Roma.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“All the legions, Caesar?” Agrippa ventured.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator smiled. “You would prefer to stay, Lucius Agrippa? Perhaps as a general of a garrison in Cahokia, attempting to enforce the peace here with a limited number of cohorts? Or leading an expedition back up the Wemissori for gold?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No, Caesar,” Agrippa said, taken aback. “Those would not be my preferred choices.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus looked back at Tahtay. “I will be quite candid with you, Tahtay, for you have earned it. The Cahokians and their allies have served us well. We have too few legions to hold a territory of this size, and those legions are beyond weary.” The Imperator’s voice came stronger now. He seemed amused at the surprise on Tahtay’s face. “It has been a long campaign, and these legions are needed elsewhere. Like Lucius, there are few among my Romans who would welcome an even more extended posting here in the bowels of Nova Hesperia.” He glanced pointedly at Marcellinus before continuing.</p>
<p class="para-p">“And so we will fall back: some of us to the south aboard our ships, others on horses and mules to the east. Now we are confident that the Mongols’ retreat is permanent, I have already sent the Polovtsians ahead along Marcellinus’s road back to Chesapica. The sturdiest of our infantry cohorts and the other cavalry will be on the march just as soon as they are resupplied at Cahokia. The rest of us will be on our way a day or so later, riding the Mizipi south. With vigorous rowing the fleet can be at the Market of the Mud in little more than a month and then out into the Mare Solis. Then up the coast and across the Atlanticus just as soon as weather permits.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That is good news. And I wish you well on your journey, Caesar.” Tahtay stood back and shot Marcellinus a relieved look, but Marcellinus’s eyes were on Lucius Agrippa. The Praetor seemed altogether too calm, and the conversation between him and the Imperator felt staged. He waited.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus nodded in thanks, and his eyes narrowed. “However…”</p>
<p class="para-p">Here it came.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page472" title="472"/>
<p class="para-p">“By the terms of our original treaty, I promised you that Cahokia and Ocatan would be free and independent cities within Nova Hesperia. In return you promised me corn, guides, and gold. Corn and guides we have received in abundance. But I see no gold.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay stood, speechless.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator’s tone became quiet, conciliatory. “Pinning your sash was brave and noble, Tahtay. We will not forget your loyalty and valor on Roma’s behalf, and that is why we will honor our agreement in full. We will pause in Cahokia to load our corn and then be gone. But we must also have gold, and you must provide it if you wish to keep your lands free of Roma.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“But since then we have fought by your side. Helped you win a war we knew nothing about when we made our treaty. That counts for nothing?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It counts for a great deal. But if my legions had never come to Nova Hesperia, what then? Without us, Cahokia would have fallen to the Mongols. By now this entire land would be groaning under the Mongol heel. We fought so that you might be brought into the light as Roman subjects rather than toiling in the darkness as Mongol slaves. I am sure you will agree that allying with Roma was the better bargain. But now Roma must be paid for the blood it has spilled on your behalf, and that payment must be in gold.</p>
<p class="para-p">“By the time of the Midsummer Feast next year, I am confident that your Blackfoot and Hidatsa friends can deliver enough gold to our garrison at the Chesapica to fill a drekar. If so, then I believe I will be able to satisfy my senators that there is no need for Roma to march into your lands once again.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Lucius Agrippa spoke again at last. “Naturally, we will require such a payment on an annual basis.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay’s lip curled. “You speak now of <em class="char-i">tribute</em>?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator smiled. “Do we have an agreement, Tahtay of Cahokia?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The war chief shook his head. “I know nothing about how to collect gold from rivers or pull it from the earth!”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page473" title="473"/>
<p class="para-p">“You are an ingenious people,” Hadrianus said. “I am confident that you will learn quickly.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus could see Tahtay’s mind spinning. “But if I swear to this, Roma will leave Hesperia for good?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Our garrisons will remain at Vinlandia and Chesapica and perhaps also in the far south,” said Agrippa. “Those outposts will be permanent. But Cahokia and all other Mizipian cities and towns will be left in peace.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And if I do not swear?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Agrippa smiled. “Then perhaps the Imperator might be forced to retract his generous offer.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Just so,” Hadrianus said. “Just so.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay looked dour, and was obviously only controlling himself with difficulty. “And if I have the corn brought to the banks of the Mizipi, you will truly go? Load your food and leave our lands as quickly as you can? <em class="char-i">You</em> will swear this to <em class="char-i">me</em>?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I cannot swear in blood this time, for I have little to spare,” Hadrianus said. “But yes, Tahtay: the legions will leave, and this will all be over.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay studied the Imperator’s face, then looked at Marcellinus, and finally nodded grimly. “Well, then. It appears I have little choice. Let me talk to my council, and see what can be done.”</p>
<p class="para-p">And with that, the war chief bowed and abruptly withdrew from the Imperial presence.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Marcellinus caught up with Tahtay before he had gone a hundred yards. He had been afraid his young friend would run in his attempt to get as far as possible from the Praetorium tent of Hadrianus, but the war chief was walking at a determined pace, threading his way between the Roman tents. “Tahtay, wait.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay kept moving. “I am sure that the Imperator has sent you after me to coax and cajole so that I will do what he wants. Is that not the service he demands from you?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hadrianus did not send me.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page474" title="474"/>
<p class="para-p">“Then what?” The war chief glanced at him, then slowed, blowing out his anger in a long breath. “Kimimela is right. I am an idiot. I wanted to believe well of the Imperator. I believed he would show us as much honor as we have shown him. But I was wrong, and Sintikala and the others were right. After going through all this, we have won nothing.”</p>
<p class="para-p">By the Imperator’s lights, he was being astonishingly generous. Marcellinus was sure that if it had been left to Agrippa, the Praetor would have driven a much harsher bargain. He drew Tahtay toward the muddy riverbank and away from the tents, so that they would not be overheard. “Tahtay, Roma will leave Cahokia. The Great City will no longer be subject to an army of occupation. The remaining cohorts will be on the coast of the Atlanticus, weeks away from mound-builder territory. Perhaps it is the best we could have hoped for.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Chesapica is not so far,” Tahtay said bitterly. “And what of our brothers of the Powhatani? Are they not also Hesperian? Are they not of the League?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Just a few years earlier, a Cahokian paramount chief would have given scant thought to what happened in the territory of the Algon-Quian. “Yes, you are right. Chesapica is not so far.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And I must command the Blackfoot and the Shoshoni and the Hidatsa of the Plains to mine gold for Roma?” Tahtay raised his hands above his head in frustration. “How can I do that? How can I tell all my chiefs this? I cannot. I will not.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Better you than a man like Agrippa or Verus,” Marcellinus pointed out.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay looked at him long and hard. For a moment Marcellinus thought he would turn on his heel and march away again, but the war chief seemed to calm himself and regain his resolve. “Very well, then. And so, now it is time for you to decide. Who are you today? Who will you be?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The blunt question caught him by surprise. “Me?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, you. Are you Roman or Cahokian? My friend or Roma’s? Hotah or Praetor?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page475" title="475"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus felt brittle. “Always I have tried to be both.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay was already shaking his head. “Yes, always you try that, Gaius. Always you try.”</p>
<p class="para-p">At that, Marcellinus was silent.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay studied him. “Let me be clear, perhaps for the last time. When I gathered my Army of Ten Thousand against Roma, when we prepared to attack the Third and 27th Legions, there were things we could not tell you, neither I, nor Kimimela, nor Sintikala. And it was the same with you and Roma: you knew of the Mongols for many moons before you told Cahokia.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We—”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay made a sharp gesture to cut him off. “And now we are here, you and I, on the banks of the Wemissori. And once again I have made plans, Hotah. I was not sure I would need them, whether to believe what Sintikala and the others have been telling me all this time, but after what I just heard? Now I am sure. I am very sure.</p>
<p class="para-p">“But after all you and I have been through, I find that I do not want to keep you in the dark again. We have all deceived one another enough these past two hands of winters. If you and I are friends, if we ever were, then we should have no secrets. And if you and Sintikala are really to be husband and wife, the two of you should never have secrets again either.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay put his head on one side, as he had occasionally when he was a boy. “And if we all cannot be honest, perhaps you belong with Roma after all. And so I need to know. Are you the big Praetor, Gaius Publius Marcellinus? Or are you Wanageeska of the Raven clan? Kimi says you can have all of these names, but that is not for her to say. I say you cannot, and I am what you made me: the paramount chief of Cahokia.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked into his eyes. “And so it has come to that? I must declare myself, be one or the other?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes. For there is much I would tell you. Many suspicions and many plans. But I cannot tell the Praetor. I will only tell Hotah.</p>
<p class="para-p">“So. Today-now, my friend. Here, before me and before the sky, you must choose.”</p></div></body></html>

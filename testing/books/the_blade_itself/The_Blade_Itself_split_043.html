<div id="filepos1275671" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Each Man Worships Himself</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro stared at the big pink through narrowed eyes, and he stared back. It had been going on for a good while now, not all the time, but most of it. Staring. They were all ugly, these soft white things, but this one was something special.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Hideous.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She knew that she was scarred, and weathered by sun and wind, worn down by years in the wilderness, but the pale skin on this one’s face looked like a shield hard used in battle—chopped, gouged, torn, dented. It was surprising to see the eyes still alive in a face so battered, but they were, and they were watching her.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She had decided he was dangerous.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Not just big, but strong. Brutal strong. Twice her weight maybe, and his thick neck was all sinew. She could feel the strength coming off him. She wouldn’t have been surprised if he could lift her with one hand, but that didn’t worry her too much. He’d have to get a hold on her first. Big and strong can make a man slow.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Slow and dangerous don’t mix.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Scars didn’t worry her either. They just meant he’d been in a lot of fights, they didn’t say whether he’d won. It was other things. The way he sat—still but not quite relaxed. Ready. Patient. The way his eyes moved—cunning, careful, from her to the rest of the room, then back to her. Dark eyes, watching, thoughtful. Weighing her up. Thick veins on the backs of his hands, but long fingers, clever fingers, lines of dirt under the nails. One finger missing. A white stump. She didn’t like any of it. Smelled like danger.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She wouldn’t want to fight this one unarmed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But she’d given her knife over to that pink on the bridge. She’d been on the very point of stabbing him, but at the last moment she’d changed her mind. Something in his eyes had reminded her of Aruf, before the Gurkish stuck his head on a spear. Sad and level, as if he understood her. As if she was a person, and not a thing. At the last moment, despite herself, she’d given the blade away. Allowed herself to be led in here.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Stupid!</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She regretted it now, bitterly, but she’d fight any way she could, if she had to. Most people never realise how full the world is of weapons. Things to throw, or throw enemies on to. Things to break, or use as clubs. Wound-up cloths to strangle with. Dirt to fling in faces. Failing that, she’d bite his throat out. She curled her lips back and showed him her teeth to prove it, but he seemed not to notice. Just sat there, watching. Silent, still, ugly, and dangerous.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Fucking pinks,” she hissed to herself.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The thin one, by contrast, hardly seemed dangerous at all. Ill-looking, with long hair like a woman’s. Awkward and twitchy, licking his lips. He would sneak the odd glance at her, but look away as soon as she scowled over at him, swallowing, the knobbly lump in his neck squirming up and down. He seemed scared, no threat, but Ferro kept him in the corner of her eye while she watched the big one. Best not to dismiss him entirely.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Life had taught her to expect surprises.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">That just left the old man. She didn’t trust a one of these pinks, but she trusted this bald one least of all. Many deep lines on his face, round his eyes, round his nose. Cruel lines. Hard, heavy bones in his cheeks. Big thick hands, white hairs on the backs of them. If she had to kill these three, for all the danger that the big one seemed to offer, she decided she would kill this bald one first. He had the look of a slaver in his eye, staring at her up and down, all over. A cold look, judging what she might be worth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bastard.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz, Yulwei called him, and the two old men seemed to know each other well. “So, brother,” the bald pink was saying in the Kantic tongue, though it was plain enough they weren’t related, “how is it in the great Empire of Gurkhul?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei sighed. “Only a year since he seized the crown, and Uthman has broken the last of the rebels, and brought the governors firmly to heel. Already, the young Emperor is more feared than ever his father was. Uthman-ul-Dosht, his soldiers call him, and proudly. Almost all of Kanta is in his grip. He reigns supreme all round the Southern Sea.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Aside from Dagoska.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“True, but his eyes are bent on it. His armies swarm toward the peninsula, and his agents are ever busy behind Dagoska’s great walls. Now that there is war in the North, it cannot be long before he feels the time is ripe to lay siege to the city, and when he does, I do not think it can stand long against him.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Are you sure? The Union still controls the seas.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei frowned. “We saw ships, brother. Many great ships. The Gurkish have built a fleet. A powerful one, in secret. They must have begun years ago, during the last war. I fear the Union will control the seas but little longer.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A fleet? I had hoped to have a few more years in which to prepare.” The bald pink sounded grim. “My plans only become the more urgent.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She was bored with their talk. She was used to being always on the move, keeping always one stride ahead, and she hated to stand still. Stay too long in one place, and the Gurkish would find you. She wasn’t interested in being an exhibit for these curious pinks to stare at. She sauntered off around the room while the two old men made endless words, scowling and sucking her teeth. She swung her arms around. She kicked at the worn boards of the floor. She poked at the cloths on the walls, and peered behind them, ran her fingers along the edges of the furniture, clicked her tongue and snapped her teeth together.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Making everyone nervous.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She passed by the big ugly pink in the chair, almost close enough for her swinging hand to touch his pitted skin. Just to show him that she didn’t care a shit for his size, or his scars, or anything else. Then she strutted over to the nervous one. The skinny pink with the long hair. He swallowed as she came close.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Sssss,” she hissed at him. He muttered something and shuffled away, and she stepped up to the open window in his place. Looking out, turning her back on the room.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Just to show the pinks she didn’t care a shit for any of them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There were gardens outside the window. Trees, plants, wide sweeps of lawn neatly arranged. Groups of fat, pale men and women lazed around in the sun on the carefully cut grass, stuffing their sweaty faces with food. Swilling down drink. She scowled down at them. Fat, ugly, lazy pinks, with no God but eating and idleness.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gardens,” she sneered.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There had been gardens in Uthman’s palace. She used to look at them from the tiny window of her room. Her cell. Long before he became Uthman-ul-Dosht. When he had only been the Emperor’s youngest son. When she had been one among his many slaves. His prisoner. Ferro leaned forward and spat out of the window.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She hated gardens.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She hated cities altogether. Places of slavery, fear, degradation. Their walls were the walls of a prison. The sooner she was gone from this accursed place the happier she would be. Or the less unhappy, at least. She turned away from the window, and scowled again. They were all staring at her.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The one called Bayaz was the first to speak. “It certainly is quite a striking thing you’ve discovered, brother. You wouldn’t miss her in a crowd, eh? Are you sure she’s what I’m looking for?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei looked at her for a minute. “As sure as I can be.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m standing right here,” she growled at them, but the bald pink went on talking as though she couldn’t hear.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Does she feel pain?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But little. She fought an Eater on the road.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Really?” Bayaz chuckled softly to himself. “How badly did it hurt her?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Badly, but in two days she was walking, in a week she was healed. She shows not a scratch from it. That is not normal.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We have both seen many things that are not normal in our times. We must be sure.” The bald man reached into a pocket. Ferro watched suspiciously as he pulled out his fist, placed it on the table. When he took it away two smooth, polished stones lay on the wood.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The bald man leaned forward. “Tell me, Ferro, which is the blue stone?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She stared at him, hard, then down at the stones. There was no difference between them. They were all watching her, closer than ever now, and she ground her teeth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That one.” She pointed to the one on the left.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz smiled. “Exactly the answer I was hoping for.” Ferro shrugged her shoulders. Lucky, she thought, to guess the right one. Then she noticed the look on the big pink’s face. He was frowning at the two stones, as though he didn’t understand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They both are red,” said Bayaz. “You see no colours at all, eh, Ferro?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">So the bald pink had played a trick on her. She wasn’t sure how he could have known, but she was sure she didn’t like it. No one plays tricks on Ferro Maljinn. She started to laugh. A rough, ugly, unpractised gurgling.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Then she sprang across the table.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The look of surprise was just forming on the old pink’s face as her fist crunched into his nose. He gave a grunt, chair tipping backwards, sprawling out onto the floor. She scrambled across the table to get at him, but Yulwei grabbed hold of her leg and dragged her back. Her clawing hands missed the bald bastard’s neck and hauled the table over on its side instead, the two stones skittering away across the boards.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She shook her leg free and went for the old pink as he staggered up from the floor, but Yulwei caught her arm and pulled her back again, all the while yelling, “Peace!” He got her elbow in his face for his trouble, and sagged back against the wall with her on top of him. She was first up, ready to go at the bald bastard again.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">By now the big one was on his feet though, and moving forward, still watching her. Ferro smiled at him, fists clenched at her sides. Now she would see how dangerous he really was.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He took another step.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Then Bayaz put an arm out to stop him. He had his other hand clasped to his nose, trying to staunch the flow of blood. He started to chuckle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Very good!” He coughed. “Very fierce, and damn quick too. Without a doubt, you’re what we’re after! I hope you will accept my apologies, Ferro.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“For my awful manners.” He wiped blood from his upper lip. “I deserved no less, but I had to be sure. I am sorry. Am I forgiven?” He looked somehow different now, though nothing had changed. Friendly, considerate, honest. Sorry. But it took more than that to win her trust. A lot more.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We’ll see,” she hissed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s all I ask. That, and that you give Yulwei and I a moment to discuss some… matters. Matters best discussed in private.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It’s alright, Ferro,” said Yulwei, “they are friends.” She was damn sure they weren’t her friends, but she allowed him to shepherd her out of the door behind the two pinks. “Just try not to kill any of them.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">This room was much like the other. They had to be rich, these pinks, for all they didn’t look it. Great big fireplace, made of dark veined stone. Cushions, and soft cloth round the window, covered in flowers and birds in tiny stitches. There was a painting of a stern man with a crown on his head, frowning down at Ferro from the wall. She frowned back at him. Luxury.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro hated luxury even more than she hated gardens.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Luxury meant captivity more surely than the bars of a cage. Soft furniture spelled danger more surely than weapons. Hard ground and cold water was all she needed. Soft things make you soft, and she wanted no part of that.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was another man waiting in there, walking round and round with his hands behind his back, as though he didn’t like to stand still too long. Not quite a pink, his leathery skin was somewhere between hers and theirs in tone. Head shaved, like a priest. Ferro didn’t like that.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She hated priests most of all.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">His eyes lit up when he saw her though, for all her sneering at him, and he hurried over. A strange little man in travel-worn clothes, the top of his head came up no higher than Ferro’s mouth. “I am Brother Longfoot,” flapping his hands around all over the place, “of the great order of Navigators.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Lucky for you.” Ferro turned her shoulder towards him, straining her ears to hear what the two old men were saying beyond the door, but Longfoot was not deterred.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It is lucky! Yes, yes, it most certainly is! God has truly blessed me! I declare that never, in all of history, has a man been so well suited to his profession, or a profession to a man, as I, Brother Longfoot, am suited to the noble science of Navigation! From the snow-covered mountains of the far North, to the sun-drenched sands of the utmost South, the whole world is my home, truly!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He smiled at her with a look of sickening self-satisfaction. Ferro ignored him. The two pinks, the big one and the scrawny one, were talking to each other on the far side of the room. They spoke in some language she didn’t understand. Sounded like pigs grunting. Talking about her maybe, but she didn’t care. They went out another door, leaving her alone with the priest, still flapping his lips.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There are few nations within the Circle of the World to which I, Brother Longfoot, am a stranger, and yet I am at a loss as to your origins.” He waited expectantly, but Ferro said nothing. “You would like me to guess, then? Indeed, it is a riddle. Let me see… your eyes have the shape of the people of distant Suljuk, where the black mountains rise sheer from the sparkling sea, indeed they do, and yet your skin is—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Stop your mouth, cunt.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The man paused in mid-sentence, coughed and moved away, leaving Ferro to attend to the voices on the other side of the door. She smiled to herself. The wood was thick and the sounds were muffled, but the two old men had not reckoned on the sharpness of her ears. They were still speaking in Kantic. Now that idiot of a Navigator was quiet she could make out every word that Yulwei was saying.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“…Khalul breaks the Second Law, so you must break the First? I like it not, Bayaz! Juvens would never have allowed this!” Ferro frowned. Yulwei had a strange note in his voice. Fear. The Second Law. He had spoken of it to the Eaters, Ferro remembered. It is forbidden to eat the flesh of men.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She heard the bald pink next. “The First Law is a paradox. All magic comes from the Other Side, even ours. Whenever you change a thing you touch the world below, whenever you make a thing you borrow from the Other Side, and there is always a cost.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But the cost of this might be too high! It is a cursed thing, this Seed, a damned thing. Nothing but chaos grows from it! The sons of Euz, so great in wisdom and power, this Seed was the end of them, of all of them, in different ways. Are you wiser than Juvens, Bayaz? Are you more cunning than Kanedias? Are you stronger than Glustrod?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“None of those, brother, but tell me… how many Eaters has Khalul made?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A long pause. “I cannot be sure.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“How many?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Another pause. “Perhaps two hundred. Perhaps more. The priesthood scour the South for those with any promise. Faster and faster now he makes them, but most are young, and weak.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Two hundred or more, and growing all the time. Many are weak, but among them are some that might be a match for you or I. Those that were Khalul’s apprentices in the Old Time—the one they called the East Wind, and those cursed bloody twins.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Damn those bitches!” Yulwei groaned.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not to mention Mamun, whose lies began this chaos.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The trouble was well rooted before he was even born, you know it, Bayaz. Still Mamun was in the Badlands. I felt him near. He is grown terrible strong.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You know that I am right. Meanwhile, our numbers hardly grow.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I thought this one, Quai, showed promise?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We need only a hundred more like him and twenty years in which to train them. Then we might stand on equal terms. No, brother, no. We must use fire against fire.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Even if the fire burns you and all creation to ashes? Let me go to Sarkant. Khalul might yet hear reason—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Laughter. “He has enslaved half the world! When will you wake, Yulwei? When he has enslaved the rest of it? I cannot afford to lose you, brother!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Remember, Bayaz, there are worse things than Khalul. Far worse.” His voice dropped to a whisper and Ferro strained to hear. “The Tellers of Secrets are always listening…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Enough, Yulwei! It is better not even to think of it!” Ferro frowned. What was this nonsense? Tellers of Secrets? What secrets?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Remember what Juvens told you, Bayaz. Beware of pride. You have been using the Art. I know it. I see a shadow on you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Damn your shadows! I do what I must! Remember what Juvens told </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">you</span></span><span class="calibre3">, Yulwei. One cannot watch forever. Time is short, and I will watch no longer. I am first. It is my decision to make.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Have I not always followed where you have led? Always, even when my conscience told me otherwise?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And have I ever led you wrong?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That remains to be seen. You are first, Bayaz, but you are not Juvens. It is my part to question, and that of Zacharus too. He will like this still less than I. Far less.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It must be done.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But others will pay the price, as they always have. This Northman, Ninefingers, he can speak to the spirits?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes.” Ferro frowned. Spirits? The nine-fingered pink had scarcely looked as if he could speak to other humans.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And if you find the Seed,” came Yulwei’s voice from behind the door, “you mean for Ferro to carry it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“She has the blood, and someone must.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Be careful then, Bayaz. I know you, remember. Few better. Give me your word that you will keep her safe, even after she has served your purpose.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I will guard her more closely than I would my own child.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Guard her closer than you did the Maker’s child, and I will be satisfied.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A long silence. Ferro worked her jaw as she thought on what she had heard. Juvens, Kanedias, Zacharus—the strange names meant nothing to her. And what kind of seed could burn all creation to ashes? She wanted no part of any such thing, she was sure of that. Her place was in the south, fighting the Gurkish with weapons that she understood.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The door opened, and the two old men stepped through. They could hardly have looked more different. One dark-skinned, tall and bony with long hair, the other white-skinned, heavy-built and bald. She looked at them suspiciously. It was the white one who spoke first.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ferro, I have an offer to—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I am not going with you, old pink fool.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The slightest shadow of annoyance flitted across the bald man’s face, but was quickly mastered. “Why? What other business have you which is so very pressing?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">That needed no thinking about. “Vengeance.” Her favourite word.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah. I see. You hate the Gurkish?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They owe you a debt, for what they have done to you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“For taking your family, your people, your country?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“For making you a slave,” he whispered. She glowered back at him, wondering how he knew so much about her, wondering whether to go for him again. “They have robbed you, Ferro, robbed you of everything. They have stolen your life from you. If I were you… if I had suffered as you have suffered… there would not be enough blood in all the South to satisfy me. I would see every Gurkish soldier made a corpse before I was satisfied. I would see every Gurkish city burn before I was satisfied. I would see their Emperor rotting in a cage before his own palace before I was satisfied!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes!” she hissed, a fierce smile across her face. He was talking her language now. Yulwei had never talked so—perhaps this old pink wasn’t so bad after all. “You understand! That is why I must go south!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No, Ferro.” It was the bald man grinning now. “You do not realise the chance that I am offering you. The Emperor does not truly rule in Kama. Mighty though he seems, he dances to the tune of another, a hand well hidden. Khalul, they call him.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Prophet.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz nodded. “If you are cut, do you hate the knife, or the one who wields it? The Emperor, the Gurkish, they are but Khalul’s tools, Ferro. Emperors come and go, but the Prophet is always there, behind them. Whispering. Suggesting. Ordering. He is the one that owes you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Khalul… yes.” The Eaters had used that name. Khalul. The Prophet. The Emperor’s palace was filled with priests, everyone knew it. The palaces of the governors too. Priests, they were everywhere, swarming, like insects. In the cities, in the villages, in amongst the soldiers, always spreading their lies. Whispering. Suggesting. Ordering. Yulwei was frowning, unhappy, but Ferro knew that the old pink was right. “Yes, I see it!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Help me, and I will give you vengeance, Ferro. Real vengeance. Not one dead soldier, or ten, but thousands. Tens of thousands! Perhaps the Emperor himself, who knows?” He shrugged, and half turned away from her. “Still, I cannot force you. Go back to the Badlands, if you wish—hide, and run, and grub in the dust like a rat. If that satisfies you. If that is the full measure of your vengeance. The Eaters want you now. Khalul’s children. Without us they will have you, and sooner rather than later. Still, the choice is yours.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro frowned. All those years in the wilderness, fighting tooth and nail, always running, had got her nothing. No vengeance worthy of the word. If it had not been for Yulwei, she would be finished now. White bones in the desert. Meat in the bellies of the Eaters. In the cage before the Emperor’s palace.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Rotting.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She could not say no, and she knew it, but she did not like it. This old man had known exactly what to offer her. She hated to have no choice.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I will think about it,” she said.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Again, the slightest shadow of anger on the bald pink’s face, quickly covered. “Think about it then, but not for long. The Emperor’s soldiers are massing, and time is short.” He followed the others out of the room, leaving her alone with Yulwei.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I do not like these pinks,” she said, loud enough for the old one to hear her in the corridor, and then more softly. “Do we have to go with them?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You do. I must return to the South.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Someone must keep watch on the Gurkish.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei began to laugh. “Twice you have tried to kill me. Once you have tried to run away from me, but now that I am leaving you want me to stay? There’s no understanding you, Ferro.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She frowned. “This bald one says he can give me vengeance. Does he lie?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Then I must go with him.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I know. That is why I brought you here.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She could think of nothing to say. She looked down at the floor, but Yulwei surprised her by stepping forward suddenly. She raised her hand, to ward off a blow, but instead he put his arms round her and squeezed her tightly. A strange feeling. Being so close to someone else. Warm. Then Yulwei stepped away, one hand on her shoulder. “Walk in God’s footsteps, Ferro Maljinn.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh. They have no God here.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Say rather that they have many.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Many?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Had you not noticed? Here, each man worships himself.” She nodded. That seemed close to the truth. “Be careful, Ferro. And listen to Bayaz. He is the first of my order, and few indeed are wise as he.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I do not trust him.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei leaned closer. “I did not tell you to trust him.” Then he smiled, and turned his back. She watched him walk slowly to the door, then out into the corridor. She heard his bare feet flapping away on the tiles, the bangles on his arms jingling softly.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Leaving her alone with the luxury, and the gardens, and the pinks.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_43"></div></div></body>

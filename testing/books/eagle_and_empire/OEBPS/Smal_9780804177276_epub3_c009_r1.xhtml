<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">T</span>he cloud of dust approached, its contents indistinct, and then all of a sudden the Mongol squadron rode out of it as it reached the harder ground close to Yupkoyvi.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was Marcellinus’s first view of a Mongol force of any kind. His first impression was that they looked dirty and were dressed in a bewildering variety of styles.</p>
<p class="para-p">As in all barbarian armies, no two men looked the same. Some wore leather armor, others what looked like quilted hide coats that might afford quite a bit of protection against a blade or an arrow. Some sported chain mail in the Roman style, perhaps captured in battle with Roma on the other side of the world. A few rode bare-chested with only a small round shield for protection or what looked like a silken shirt with no armor at all.</p>
<p class="para-p">The men looked compact and strong. Some already wore their helmets, which were trimmed with fur and had leather flaps. Those who didn’t seemed to wear their hair in two braids, one at each side of the head, but with the scalp in between shaved bare. It gave them an oddly unsettling look.</p>
<p class="para-p">Their famed Mongol warhorses were unimpressive at first sight: short and thick-necked with shaggy manes and distended bellies. Yet those horses were the secret of the Mongols’ success, with their legendary speed across the steppes of central Asia and their agility and stamina in battle.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page118" title="118"/>
<p class="para-p">“Two hundreds,” Enopay said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You’re sure?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“One hundred Mongol warriors makes up a jaghun. I see many more than one hundred men but surely fewer than three hundreds. If Mongol squadrons travel in centuries, I mean in jaghuns, two hundreds of men may be all we face here.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked down at him. “All?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Before it looked like many more because of the spare horses kicking up dust. Two hundred is far better than a thousand. But yes, enough to be a challenge.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Damn it,” Bassus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“What? What do you see?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Back corner, tall Mongol warrior with the bright yellow armor? Those are thick leather plates, not copper or gold…but that must be Jebei Noyon, one of the Khan’s trusted generals. They call Jebei the Arrow because…well, the story isn’t clear, but some say he shot Chinggis Khan with an arrow once, before his Tayichiud tribe was conquered and he threw in his lot with the Khan.” Bassus looked at Marcellinus. “He’s tough. But he only has a couple hundred men.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Whereas we have…shit.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Behind them women and children were running out of the Great House with armfuls of spears and arrows, dumping them onto the ground in the center of the plaza, and running back in. The men of Yupkoyvi were picking up spears, thrusting them forward experimentally, muttering at one another. Not one of them was wearing armor.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sweet Cybele,” Bassus said. “This isn’t happening.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No shields,” Enopay said. “Oh, at least they’ve found some bows now to go with the arrows. Um. See those men on the other side of the plaza, sneaking down the ladders into the kiva?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Bassus turned back to Marcellinus. “Fuck these jokers; we’re wasting time. We can’t fortify this shit without concerted Handie support. Which we’re not getting. It’d be the most pathetic siege ever. So out we go.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page119" title="119"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus gave in to the inevitable. “Agreed. We ride out and take our chances.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Bassus eyed him. “You’re no cavalryman, Gaius Marcellinus. I command this action. Yes?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Cavalry tactics were not infantry tactics. Marcellinus had fought alongside cavalry wings as a centurion in Galicia-Volhynia and even commanded a mixed cohort as a tribune against the Khwarezmian Sultanate, but those battles were long ago, and today’s action would be a purely mounted affair. Sextus Bassus had trained for this all his life. “Absolutely. Your men, your command.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“Isleifur Bjarnason. You’re still here?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Bjarnason frowned as Marcellinus drew near. “Where else would I be?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Anywhere.” Marcellinus put his mouth near the Norseman’s ear. “Don’t die here. Disappear.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Run away?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes. Get clear, get word back to Cahokia of what happened here. If we all die today, the Imperator learns nothing and all of this was for naught.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Startled, Bjarnason glanced around at the Mongol force before them and the cliffs behind. “Escape how? Tunnel? I’m not a magician.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Don’t sell yourself short. Get going. Don’t tell me how you plan to do it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That should be easy enough.” The Norseman looked around again and shook his head. “I haven’t a bloody clue.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Get one.” Marcellinus clapped the man on the shoulder and climbed back to rejoin Enopay atop the front wall.</p>
<p class="para-p">If anyone could find a way to survive this day, it was the Norseman. But even for him it might be a tough call.</p>
<p class="para-p">Beneath them, Bassus was caucusing with his decurions and their deputies. “We’ll need to close quickly to negate their arrow storm. Dirty bastards only fight hand to hand when they have no choice. They’d rather sit back and let their arrows do the fighting. So we won’t give ’em that luxury. Full charge, break through their line, then wheel and mop ’em up.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page120" title="120"/>
<p class="para-p">His officers nodded grimly. All knew it could not be so simple. Bassus looked irritated. “Buck up. With our spears we’ve got the longer reach in the charge. Our horses are bigger than the scruffy-shit ponies the Mongols ride. And our spathas are longer than their sabers. All advantages to Roma, gentlemen.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sir, yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">That was all true. And with their steel helmets and greaves, breastplates and chain mail, the Roman auxiliaries were better armored than the Mongols.</p>
<p class="para-p">But the Mongols had speed and agility on their side and outnumbered them almost two to one.</p>
<p class="para-p">Bassus clapped his hands to get the attention of all the men. “Squadron, listen up. First Turma leads the charge, dense wedge formation.” He winked. “You’ll need to ride hard to keep up with me. Death or glory, eh, boys? Second and Third Turmae follow us in echelon, left and right, flying wedge, but for Cybele’s sake, adjust your position according to how the fucking Mongols react. And listen up! Follow your decurions! Not like the last time against the Iroqua, you bastards. That was a fiasco. You embarrassed your stupid selves. So pay attention while I say it again: <em class="char-i">follow your fucking decurions</em>.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He turned. “Fourth Turma, hold fast in reserve. Rest up to start. Then pile in wherever we need help or you see an opportunity to break ’em. Try to take out Jebei Noyon if you can. Mongols lose their fucking minds if you kill whoever’s telling them what to do. Not like you, though, eh? If I fall, you’ll <em class="char-i">keep fighting.</em>”</p>
<p class="para-p">Bassus turned back to the Third. “And Third Turma? God’s sake, this time <em class="char-i">thrust</em> and don’t slash. You’re not gladiators putting on a show. Kill ’em clean, kill ’em quick. I’ll be watching you from the field or from hell. Questions?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Predictably, there were none.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Saddle up, then.” Now Bassus looked up at Marcellinus. “Close the gates behind us, but be ready to let us back in after. Keep trying to marshal this Handie rabble to defend themselves just in case we don’t crush the enemy for you right out of the gate.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page121" title="121"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded. “Good luck, Decurion. Give them ten kinds of shit.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Bassus smiled, his mouth a thin line. “Ten kinds it is. Rip apart any of the bastards we miss.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Consider it done.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Decurion Sextus Bassus blew out a long breath and then inhaled again. “And thank the gods for some action at last. I was getting so fucking bored in this town.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Weren’t we all?” Marcellinus smiled wryly.</p>
<p class="para-p">Bassus made a clicking noise, and his horse raised its head and walked toward him. The decurion stepped into the stirrup and swung himself into the saddle in a single movement. He nodded once at Marcellinus, looked around him at the Great House with an expression of withering disgust, and trotted off to take the head of his formation.</p>
<p class="para-p">“He’s dead,” Enopay said hollowly. “And he…He knows we’re all dead, too. Doesn’t he, Eyanosa?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked down at the boy. Time for his own lesson in bravado. “Don’t talk nonsense, Enopay. Grab yourself a sword, stand tall, and keep your eyes open. Stay by me. And remember: ten kinds of shit.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay wiped the sweat out of his eyes and tried to calm his breathing. “Sir, yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We still have the air advantage,” Marcellinus said. “The Yupkoyvi have dozens of Macaws. The Mongols won’t be expecting that.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We hope,” Enopay said.</p>
<p class="para-p">The cornicen sounded his horn, and the cavalry of the Second Aravacorum poured out of the main gates of the Great House of Yupkoyvi and onto the field of battle.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">No amateurs at war, the Mongols had stopped to prepare. They were changing horses, climbing onto fresh mounts, dropping their packs to the ground, and tying the bridles of their spare horses together so that they could not roam far while their masters were in battle. Marcellinus saw no orders being given, could not tell which were their squadron commanders, could no longer see Jebei Noyon. The Mongol army was just a solid mass of cavalry that was only now forming up into ranks.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page122" title="122"/>
<p class="para-p">Outside the gates of Yupkoyvi the Roman cavalry had quickly fallen into formation. The First Turma formed a tight triangular formation with Sextus Bassus shouting profane orders from its apex. Behind them on either side spread the Second and Third Turmae. The cavalry advanced out into the battlefield at a brisk walk.</p>
<p class="para-p">Per orders, the Fourth waited in reserve just outside the wall. Their decurion paced back and forth in front of them. Marcellinus knew that commanding reserves was sometimes harder than being in the first wave. To see your comrades already in the fray and be helpless, knowing you might be ordered into the thickest and most desperate part of the fighting at any moment…he had always hated it. And the decurion of the Fourth looked very nervous as well as very young.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols were already advancing in a long double line. Without doubt they’d begin the battle with a cloud of arrows, wave upon wave, designed to kill as many as possible and shatter their enemy’s resolve.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus doubted that ploy would work here. Bassus was a tough commander with enough resolve to spare for everyone.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now the Mongol front line parted neatly, dividing into two halves with a space left between them. Through the space from behind came six Mongols at the gallop, riding shoulder to shoulder. Their synchronization alone was quite a feat on such rocky terrain. Among the Roman troops, only the Chernye Klobuki could possibly have ridden in such a steady formation at such a savage gallop.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then something large reared up behind the six horsemen, and Marcellinus understood.</p>
<p class="para-p">A dozen years earlier he would have thought it was a kite. Now he knew better. “Futete…”</p></div></body></html>

<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">T</span>he Mongol craft climbed into the sky at an almost uncanny angle. The cord that joined it to the galloping Mongol horsemen was too fine to see except where the sun glinted off it. The craft’s wing was broad and predatory, with a span about equal to that of a Cahokian Eagle but with a raw and jagged sawtooth shape to its trailing edge quite different from any Mizipian aerial craft. The apex of the wing came to a sharp point, making it appear to skewer the air as it flew. The craft had a long tail, indeed a little like a kite except that this tail was rigid and curved. Both the wings and the tail were etched with red and orange paint, making them glow in the desert sun.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus recognized the stylized shape. It was supposed to represent the firebird from Slavic and Asian folklore, similar to the phoenix of Greek myth. The symbol still had power as far east as the Mongol lands. But they surely had not learned the trick of flight back home. The Hesperians of the western coasts must have possessed flight after all, and the Mongols had taken it for their own, adapting the craft to their own favored shapes and aspects.</p>
<p class="para-p">Three men hung beneath the Mongol Firebird in a line, one behind the other, so closely that they almost overlapped. Mahkah shaded his eyes with his hand and squinted. “The first man holds a bar of wood to steer. The second carries a bow and also cords that lead to…sacks under the wings. The third pulls taut four ropes that attach to the back of the wings. As he tugs them, it changes the curve of the wing. To help direct the bird?” Mahkah shook his head. “Sintikala would understand.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page124" title="124"/>
<p class="para-p">The details hardly mattered. “<em class="char-i">Damn</em> them,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Roma’s biggest advantage over the Mongols had just disappeared. The two sides might be much more evenly matched than the Imperator had hoped. However, the prospect of Marcellinus’s expeditionary force surviving to take this news back to Hadrianus seemed slim.</p>
<p class="para-p">A thousand feet up in the air, the Mongol Firebird finally loosed its cable; the lead pilot reached forward to unhook it manually. The six horsemen who had towed it aloft wheeled away to the right and left and slowed to a canter as they went to rejoin their fellows.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Firebird soared over the walls of the Great House, still rising, picking up more lift from the heat of the sun on the desert sands as well as the breeze that blew against the cliff.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Shit,” Taianita said. “Cowards…”</p>
<p class="para-p">As one, the Macaws that had whirled over their heads were retreating for the safety of the cliff tops. Like a raptor terrorizing smaller birds, fear of the Firebird had banished all the Macaws from the air in a single stroke. “Pezi! Tell Chochokpi to order the Macaws back aloft! A single Mongol bird cannot possibly threaten all of them!”</p>
<p class="para-p">But Marcellinus did not wait for a response. Even while Pezi was bellowing the translation at the Yupkoyvi chief, the Roman ran to the ladder down to the plaza of the Great House.</p>
<p class="para-p">From directly above came a bright flash and a resounding thunderclap, as if a storm had just appeared over them. Marcellinus’s boot slipped off the rung of the ladder, and he swung sideways, banging his shoulder on the sunbaked clay of the wall. He felt Taianita grab at his foot and guide it back onto the ladder.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hot shards rained down around them, clinking as they landed on the roof beside him. With a dazed realization, Marcellinus saw they were slivers of porcelain.</p>
<p class="para-p">A Jin thunderclap bomb had exploded in the air above them. From his discussions with the other Praetors back in Cahokia, Marcellinus knew that the thunderclap bombs contained the explosive Jin salt and sharp fragments of potsherds, all wrapped in a shell of stiff paper. Those were the small black powder bombs: the much larger and heavier thunder crash bombs were encased in iron, probably too heavy to haul aloft.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page125" title="125"/>
<p class="para-p">Fluttering down around him now were scarlet feathers.</p>
<p class="para-p">“The Mongol bird just <em class="char-i">blew up</em> a Macaw Warrior,” Taianita said. <em class="char-i">“Blew up.”</em></p>
<p class="para-p">The Firebird streaked over them. Another explosion came, this time from the top of the sandstone cliff, hurling two Macaws into the sky. The wings and their pilots toppled untidily down the cliff to the canyon floor.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Holy Jove,” Marcellinus said. “Holy fucking Jove…”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The two mounted squads approached each other across the rocky ground of the Yupkoyvi canyon.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols had broken into five lines, each of around forty horsemen, some well armored in steel and carrying lances, others the nimbler, more lightly equipped horse archers. All five ranks came forward at the trot.</p>
<p class="para-p">As Mahkah again arrived at Marcellinus’s side, a single arrow arced high over the army, squealing in the air. “Whistling arrow,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">On the signal, the first rank of horse archers whipped their horses into a gallop, and suddenly arrows were flying.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols were shooting, their arrows coming thick and fast even as they galloped, and then the first rank peeled off from the charge, moving obliquely in front of the Romans to flank them. The second rank came on with long lances at the ready. And behind <em class="char-i">them</em>, the remaining horse archers were shooting more arrows high in the air. The storm of death flew over the Mongols’ charging cavalry and came raining down on the men and horses of the Second Aravacorum.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had never seen Mongol archers in action before. Their rate of fire seemed uncanny. It was almost impossible to believe that only a hundred or so archers could loose their arrows swiftly enough to create such a dark, deadly storm over the Romans.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page126" title="126"/>
<p class="para-p">Mahkah snapped his fingers twice a second. “They are firing fast. Each archer holds several arrows in his fingers, looses the bowstring with his thumb to shoot, immediately nocks another.”</p>
<p class="para-p">At a snarled command from Bassus that was clearly audible back at the Great House walls, the Roman cavalrymen spurred their mounts into a canter. The natural bouncing gait helped make them harder targets and closed the distance to the Mongols more speedily.</p>
<p class="para-p">Another wave of arrows hurtled across the rapidly decreasing gap between the two armies, and then a third. Romans were going down now, tumbling back off their horses as their chain mail was pierced by the deadly arrow swarm. Other arrows glanced off the barding on the horse’s breasts and heads.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus could no longer hear the commands, but at a separation of two hundred paces Bassus’s First Turma broke into a full gallop. The Second and Third matched them, holding formation.</p>
<p class="para-p">The two sides converged. Enopay swore under his breath by Marcellinus’s side, half covering his eyes and half squinting to see better through the brightness and dust of the afternoon. Mahkah stood still as a stone, unblinking.</p>
<p class="para-p">Lines of horses at a charge did not physically collide, of course. No horse would consent to be charged straight at a wall of men or a wall of other horses. The two lines passed through each other, the soldiers of both sides firing arrows, throwing spears, aiming lances, swinging swords.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols’ greater numbers prevailed, and their hooked lances did much greater damage than did the lighter hasta and spathas of the Romans. The Third Turma in particular had taken a beating in that first clash. Most of its troopers were down, unhorsed, struggling to their feet while their steeds bounded away from them.</p>
<p class="para-p">The First and Second Turmae regrouped. The Romans were pausing to recover their breath. The Mongol light archers and their mounts apparently had no need to breathe, because they had already re-formed a line and were charging again. The archers leaned forward to brace themselves, almost standing in the stirrups as they sent another cloud of arrows into the Roman cavalry.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page127" title="127"/>
<p class="para-p">Above, the Mongol Firebird had turned. The light breeze was not in its favor and it seemed heavier than the three-pilot Cahokian Eagles, but it was making good headway back across the battlefield. The middle pilot was releasing more bombs, and they were falling away from the bird, one, two, three…Two ignited in midair, smoke bombs that gushed noxious black fumes and came to earth between the battle and the walls of Yupkoyvi. The third was a black powder bomb, yet another thunderclap, that exploded above Bassus and his men and showered them with lethally sharp shards of porcelain.</p>
<p class="para-p">The effect was immediate. Legionaries jerked and flailed in their saddles, some tumbling off; their horses also reacted instantly as the shrapnel drove into them. Bassus’s horse bucked, throwing him forward over its head and down onto the ground. Astonishingly, the decurion managed to roll and come up onto his feet, shaking his head as if dazed but still holding his sword. Others, less fortunate, lay still and crumpled on the ground.</p>
<p class="para-p">Even through the smoke that now wreathed the battlefield it was clear that the three Roman turmae were broken. Most of the men were down, maybe half of the Second Turma on the left still mounted but struggling to control their horses, cut off from the others.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Romans, to me!” Bassus roared. “To me! Form two lines, back to back! <em class="char-i">Move</em>, you slack bastards!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Outside the gate below Marcellinus the troopers of the Fourth milled, its decurion still standing by his horse. From ground level he could not see all that Marcellinus could from his greater height. Either that or the man had just lost his nerve. His men seemed to be arguing with him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Out on the plain most of Bassus’s cavalrymen were off their mounts, struggling to join up. Unmanned horses milled, some neighing in alarm and looking for a way to escape the field of battle, others wounded, staggering, dropping onto their haunches with plaintive and almost human screeches of pain. To Bassus’s credit, the Roman lines were forming quickly: perhaps fifty men in chain mail with swords and spathas, some limping, cramming themselves together into two close-order lines, back to back.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page128" title="128"/>
<p class="para-p">A defensive infantry formation worked well enough against horsemen if their ranks were protected by scuta, the long shields borne by legionaries. With the smaller ovals carried by the Roman troopers, it was a desperate measure.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols would not charge, Marcellinus was sure. They would merely back up and loose wave after wave of arrows into the mass of men. Mongol arrows could pierce armor if shot squarely and at close range. It would only be a matter of time.</p>
<p class="para-p">But this did not appear to be the Mongol plan. The light horse archers circled, but half a dozen warriors were dismounting, men in heavier armor who bore not simple lances of wood and steel but long tubes of iron.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Fuck it,” Marcellinus said. Bassus’s foul mouth was contagious. “Fire lances. Enopay, stay right here. Mahkah, you’re with me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Eyanosa, don’t!” Enopay’s terrified voice followed him as he jumped down off the wall and ran for his horse. “Please, Gaius, no, no!” </p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus forced himself to ignore the boy’s cries. “Pezi, Chitimachan: close the gates behind us and tell Chack and Chock that if they don’t defend the Great House, I’ll come back and tear them apart with my bare hands.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Marcellinus swung himself up into the saddle. Just inside the gate, Taianita stood ready with spears. As he approached, she raised one to him. Marcellinus snatched it and tucked it into the leather scabbard behind the saddle. “Another, quick.” Taking the second, he held it under his arm uncertainly in the couched position, but it did not feel right; it was more of a javelin than a lance. He took it into his hand again, remembering Bassus’s posture as he had ridden out.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had always been a commander of infantry. A horse had carried him to battle on countless occasions, but he had always dismounted to fight. He would need to learn fast today.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page129" title="129"/>
<p class="para-p">Mahkah rode up and took a spear from Taianita. Hanska and Mikasi were not far behind him. The People of the Hand were still milling hopelessly around the plaza, there were no Macaws in the air, and Chack and Chock had disappeared again.</p>
<p class="para-p">Nothing he could do about that. The hell with them. Marcellinus dug in his heels, and they rode through the gate together, out of the Great House and onto the battlefield.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“Ala Aravacorum!” Marcellinus shouted. “Fourth Turma, form up, three ranks!”</p>
<p class="para-p">They surged toward him as soon as he burst out of the gate. Gods knew where their decurion had gone, for Marcellinus no longer saw him among them.</p>
<p class="para-p">They were not forming ranks, but that was all right. Rattled by the Mongols’ seemingly effortless defeat of the first three turmae, many were terrified out of their wits. It was enough that they were grouping up behind Marcellinus and the Cahokians, enough that they were still hearing orders and had not been panicked into fleeing and earning Mongol arrows in their backs.</p>
<p class="para-p">“To Marcellinus!” The troopers of the Second Turma who had become detached from their fellows galloped around in a wide arc to join the Fourth.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s horse was cantering so jerkily beneath him that it was hard to spit the words out. “Spears up! If no spears, spatha! Weapons at the ready!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Smoke wafted across them. Marcellinus could not tell how many men were still with him. His horse’s head was bobbing, eyes wide, even as Marcellinus dug his heels into the animal’s flanks. A horse took its confidence from its rider and the other horses it could see. As the troopers were on the verge of panic, the horses they rode were right on the edge of spooking, too. If Marcellinus’s horse refused, bucked, or—even worse—bolted, their day was done and that would be that, and Marcellinus himself might be lying on the ground with a broken back, defenseless against a Mongol spear or blade.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page130" title="130"/>
<p class="para-p">But the horse he rode was young. Perhaps it had never yet failed a charge and so had no memory of failure.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus and the remains of the Second Aravacorum squadron bore down upon the field of battle at speed. The Mongol horse archers were swinging around to counter them but would not form a line in time. Arrows began to fly. Disregarding them, Marcellinus headed straight for Bassus and his men, who had now achieved a messy two-line formation in the face of the approaching fire lancers.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus thrust his first javelin down at one of the warriors on foot holding a fire lance, and even as it lodged in the man’s chest, Marcellinus twisted his second javelin free from the leather cup behind him and raised it over his head.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol warrior staggered back three paces but did not fall. He touched the slow match to the Jin salt packet on his fire lance, and the lance ignited with a roar. Dazzling flame shot out of the iron tube, a deadly tongue of fire ten feet long.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s horse leaped away from the bright flame. As he grabbed at his reins, the spear slid out of his hand and clattered to the ground.</p>
<p class="para-p">The fire lance swung around and flared directly at him. He felt the searing pain of flame across his chest and shoulder, saw bright sparks. Then his steed reared, and all at once Marcellinus was in the air.</p>
<p class="para-p">He crashed down to earth. All the breath was knocked from his body. All around him were boots and hooves. He instinctively tried to swing his spear around before realizing that he no longer held it. Shaking his head to clear it, Marcellinus dragged in an agonizing breath and drew his spatha.</p>
<p class="para-p">He saw flame and swung at it. His spatha rang against the metal tube of the Mongol fire lance. Marcellinus shoved himself up onto his knees and swung again.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">Thrust, don’t slash</em>: good advice from Bassus to his Third Turma, and it became Marcellinus’s instinct now. The tip of his spatha went up into the Mongol’s unprotected armpit and through his shoulder. The man screamed. Marcellinus jerked the spatha out and away with difficulty and jabbed it forward again into the man’s groin.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page131" title="131"/>
<p class="para-p">The fire lance fell, still gushing flame. When it bounced on the ground, one of Bassus’s dismounted horsemen snatched it up with great presence of mind and jammed its bright jet of fire into the face of one of the Mongol cavalry horses.</p>
<p class="para-p">An arrow went through Marcellinus’s shoulder, fired at almost point-blank range. Marcellinus roared as the pain exploded in his shoulder, but he had no time to deal with it; he had to move. He almost made it up onto his feet before a Mongol boot thudded into his chest and a swinging saber knocked the spatha out of his hand.</p>
<p class="para-p">He was under attack by two Mongol horsemen at once, and he had no weapon. He tried to grab at the nearer of the two to pull him from his horse, but a leather gauntlet slammed into his face with fearsome force. Once again Marcellinus felt as if he were flying, blue sky dazzling him.</p>
<p class="para-p">The back of his head impacted the steel of Roman chain mail. Hands slid under his arms and hauled him up. Marcellinus found himself standing with a Roman cavalryman on each side, surrounded by Mongols on horseback and on foot. His fight was over.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Marcellinus and the men around him were captured. Other legionaries fought on, but the fire lances had done their damage. The Roman line was irredeemably breached, carved into small groups of three or four men, and the mounted Mongol warriors rode between them, slashing at the troopers and knocking them to the ground. One group of Romans had rallied and managed to pull three Mongols from their horses and stab them as they lay on the ground, but as soon as the Mongols saw that happen, they drew bows and shot a barrage of arrows at the helpless troopers from just a few yards away.</p>
<p class="para-p">The fire lance closest to Marcellinus sputtered and went out, its black powder exhausted. Farther away two lances still spit their deadly fire. It blazed hotter and fiercer than any flame Marcellinus had seen before and was incredibly focused.</p>
<p class="para-p">The men who wielded the lances seemed fascinated by them. Perhaps this was the first time these particular warriors had used their terrible weapons on human prey. Their faces were subtly different from those of the Mongols: they were Jin, men of the land that had birthed the dark powder, experts in its use. And now Marcellinus saw one of the men walk over to a fallen and injured Roman and apply the flame directly to the man’s head and shoulders, bathing him in its full blast. The Roman screamed and thrashed, but only for a moment. Soon shock and pain drove him into insensibility and death. As this lance, too, ran out of powder, the Jin leaned over to study the devastation he had wrought on the Roman’s flesh, his face showing only curiosity, as a shaman might look at an animal’s entrails to augur the future.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page132" title="132"/>
<p class="para-p">Right now Marcellinus could see the future, too. He could surely predict the calamitous destruction that would come about when such weapons were turned on Cahokia and the legions of Roma.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">On the edge of the melee, Mahkah broke away. With a last slash at the Mongol warrior he was battling with, he wheeled his horse and spurred it into a gallop. One of the warriors sheathed his sword, snatched up his bow from the saddle holster, and nocked an arrow.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska had been knocked off her horse but was still on her feet, slashing with the sword in her right hand, the hasta spear in her left held ready to thrust. Two mounted Mongols were circling her, looking for their chance to take her down. Now she hefted the hasta overarm and cast it at the Mongol who was taking aim at the fleeing Mahkah.</p>
<p class="para-p">She was almost fast enough. The spear lodged in the Mongol’s thigh just as he loosed his arrow. He shouted in pain and spasmed, but even as the bow flew out of his grasp, the arrow was speeding on its way. It hit Mahkah in the left side of his back. Mahkah jerked and threw up his arms in an uncanny echo of the Mongol warrior’s reaction to Hanska’s spear, then slumped forward over his horse’s neck. A second Mongol now shot at Mahkah, but Marcellinus could not see if his arrow struck the young brave. Mahkah’s piebald steed kept going, still at the gallop, across the canyon.</p>
<p class="para-p">Two other Roman cavalrymen also had broken out and were attempting to flee westward, bent low over their mounts. One of them was the hapless decurion of the Fourth Turma. Mongols pursued them, aiming bows and using their legs to raise themselves half out of their saddles. They shot, nocked more arrows, shot again. The decurion tumbled leftward off his horse’s back to be dragged across the desert floor by his stirrups until his horse slowed. The second Roman died in the saddle, his horse turning to look almost comically at the inert rider on its back. The Mongols cantered after the decurion to finish him off, sabers and clubs at the ready.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page133" title="133"/>
<p class="para-p">Mahkah’s mount had slowed to a trot but was well out of range of Mongol arrows. His body bounced up and down on its back, his arms now hanging on each side of the horse’s neck. Fully engaged rounding up the Roman survivors, the Mongols declined to pursue him.</p>
<p class="para-p">He was probably dead anyway. “Shit,” said Marcellinus.</p>
<p class="para-p">The first pain in his side grew suddenly even worse. His eyes closed in agony. In the very next moment the Roman cavalryman holding his right arm slapped him right in the same place. Marcellinus yelled in rage and thrashed to try to free himself.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Christ, man, keep still,” the cavalryman said. “You’re on fire.”</p>
<p class="para-p">It was true. Marcellinus had taken the blast of the fire lance to his chest. His armor had saved him from the worst of it, but the tunic under his arm had been burned sheer away, and at its edges it was now in flames.</p>
<p class="para-p">With great effort of will and against all his instincts, Marcellinus forced himself to go limp. The men let him fall and threw sand and gravel on him until they quenched the flames.</p>
<p class="para-p">He lay there panting, inhaling the reek of his own scorched flesh. For a moment logical thought fled, and all he could think was that he would never see a Cahokian hearth fire again.</p>
<p class="para-p">Never see Sintikala again.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Fuck,” he said, and at the same moment the cavalrymen standing over him groaned.</p>
<p class="para-p">Glancing left, he saw the gates of Yupkoyvi creaking open even as he heard Enopay’s voice cracking as he shouted, “No! Close them, idiots, close them!”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page134" title="134"/>
<p class="para-p">Cha’akmogwi and Chochokpi chose not to take their orders from a Cahokian boy. Yupkoyvi was surrendering without a fight, and it was only now that Marcellinus realized that since the Firebird had launched, he had not seen a single Macaw Warrior in flight.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Mongols on horseback moved around the battlefield. Where they found a Roman trooper down and wounded, they speared him from the saddle, driving down into the man’s throat with all their weight until he was dead, robbing the wounded of life without even troubling to dismount. Other Mongols walked amid the devastation. As they came to each dead Roman, they knelt quickly, sliced the right ear from the corpse, tossed it into a rough hemp bag, and moved on to the next. Trophies of war or merely proof of their victory?</p>
<p class="para-p">Mikasi grunted. “Hotah? Here.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus turned his head. Sextus Bassus was down. His helmet was off, and he had a bad cut up his cheek and across his forehead. His right arm was terribly burned and blistered, and he was holding it straight, not moving it; the remains of his tunic stuck to the wound, and a sickening smell of cooked meat wafted on the air. Worse, his breathing was noisy and belabored, his breastplate cracked across, a huge gash in the chain mail beneath.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Shit. Get his armor off.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Blood bubbled at the corners of Bassus’s mouth. Mikasi looked sorrowful. “Hotah, Bassus is already dead.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Do it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Mikasi unbuckled the remains of the decurion’s breastplate and drew it aside gingerly. “There is a hole.”</p>
<p class="para-p">There was indeed a deep and messy hole in Bassus’s chest. As he tried to breathe, blood and bubbles spilled from it. “I see it. Help me get the chain mail away from it. Don’t rock him, don’t touch the hole. Bassus? Can you hear me?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The decurion narrowed his eyes and panted. Blood frothed from his chest again.</p>
<p class="para-p">“It is bad,” Mikasi said. “Bassus now breathes through his ribs, not his mouth.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page135" title="135"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked back at the wide-eyed cavalrymen lying behind him and tapped the boot of the closest with his fist to get his attention. “Soldier, rip the sleeve off your tunic. Give it to me. Quickly now.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The trooper did so. Very carefully, wrestling all the while with his own pain, Marcellinus lay the sleeve over the sucking wound and held it in place. More blood spilled from Bassus’s mouth, but his anguished expression eased and his eyes met Marcellinus’s. In moments, however, his discomfort seemed to increase and his eyes lost focus again. Marcellinus eased his pressure on the wound and felt a little air escape.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was no medicus, but he knew what his eyes were telling him. “Mikasi, Hanska: take over here. Let the air out from his chest but not in. Release the pressure every few moments. And clean that blood away from his mouth. D’you see?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes.” Mikasi took over.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Noyon,” said one of the cavalrymen.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol general was approaching on foot, walking his dappled horse between the bodies of the slain. He was almost a head taller than the other Mongols, a lean, strong-looking man in his forties. His armor of yellow leather hung easily on him as if he had been born to it. He stared at Marcellinus and his captives with a cold and malevolent gaze, as if he would like nothing better than to rend them limb from limb with his own hands and leave their bodies to decay in the dust of the desert. He looked like a man without a soul, a murderous machine.</p>
<p class="para-p">Daunted, Marcellinus looked at Jebei’s horse instead, which was much less imposing. Small by the standard of the Libyans and Hispanians favored by the Romans, the general’s mount was stocky, its mane tangled, its tail long and unkept. The Mongol horses were ugly beasts, but they were certainly hardy.</p>
<p class="para-p">The general arrived. He stared at Marcellinus, who met his eye again. Jebei Noyon’s gaze then lowered to take in the burn in Marcellinus’s side, the hole where the arrow had passed through his shoulder, and then down at his right leg. It was only during these moments of inspection that Marcellinus realized that indeed, at some point in the battle he had received a bloody slash in his calf in almost the same place he had been injured in the fight on the Great Mound the day Great Sun Man had died. The pain of the leg wound had been masked by the agony of his burn.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page136" title="136"/>
<p class="para-p">Jebei turned his attention to Bassus, recognizing him as a Roman officer by the red plume on his helmet, and looked at the blood that was still spreading around his chest wound. Giving the other huddled Roman troopers a cursory glance, the Mongol general then looked carefully at Mikasi and Hanska. Hanska he examined from braids to boots with an intensity that would have seemed perverse if it were not so cold. It was clear that he had rarely, if ever, come across a woman warrior.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was a little uncanny to be studied as if they were animals or already dead meat. Marcellinus felt chilled. Even in the battle’s aftermath he could see the implacable ruthlessness of the Mongols. In those moments he understood their terrible reputation for ferocity. To Jebei Noyon, Marcellinus and the others were less than human.</p>
<p class="para-p">Looking past the general, Marcellinus saw that meanwhile the Mongol warriors had ridden in through the gates of Yupkoyvi unopposed. The sounds of screams came from within. If the Yupkoyvi shaman-chiefs had hoped to preserve their people by opening the gates without further resistance, they were sadly mistaken. The Mongols lived by a different code. The People of the Hand had merely facilitated their own massacre.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus swallowed with difficulty. What of Enopay? What of Taianita, the Chitimachan? Lying on the ground two hundred yards away, he could see nothing of them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus said: “We will need to carry my decurion to the Great House. Other men have wounds to be treated.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol general stared at him again with that cold, dispassionate interest.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Come on, man, the battle is over. Help us.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Jebei raised his boot and drove it into Marcellinus’s shoulder, just above the arrow wound. Marcellinus bellowed and fell back, eyes streaming with pain.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska glared. “Or just kill us all and get it over with. Add our corpses to your pile and our ears to your bag of souvenirs. Why not? Bastard.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page137" title="137"/>
<p class="para-p">Jebei shook his head. He spoke in a guttural language the like of which Marcellinus had never heard before.</p>
<p class="para-p">With dazed disbelief, Marcellinus saw Pezi and Taianita walking out of the gates of Yupkoyvi, accompanied by one of the Mongol horse archers. They drew up, and even more to his surprise, Pezi bowed deeply to Jebei Noyon, to Marcellinus, and to the almost unconscious form of Sextus Bassus. “Wanageeska.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Pezi.” The dizzy feeling of unreality swept Marcellinus again. He felt as if he might float away. He resisted the urge to laugh manically. “What now? Have you switched sides again?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi frowned and shook his head. “I think you have lost much blood.” He made a rather imperious gesture to Taianita, ordering her forward, and Taianita knelt by Bassus to examine his wound.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I told them Taianita is a great healer and knows much.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus struggled to keep his face expressionless. Taianita was no Chumanee. She had some limited experience with battle wounds but knew little even of herbs, let alone of an injury as severe as Bassus’s. “Be careful with your lies, Pezi.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“My lies may yet save our skins,” Pezi said. “You should bow and honor me even as I honor you, so that these filthy men see that we are both important and do not add our ears to their bag.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sit up, Gaius.” Taianita tugged at Marcellinus’s arm, her young eyes lined with concern. “Sit <em class="char-i">up</em>.” Without waiting, she started to ease tatters of his tunic from the burned gash in his torso.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Obey her, Wanageeska. Let her see,” said Pezi, and Marcellinus relented. Perhaps if he could just breathe more easily his mind would not float away and he might make better sense of what was going on here. However, when he sat up, he immediately felt dizzy, as if his body no longer belonged to him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi bowed deeply again and addressed the Mongol general, first in the language of the Hand and then in Iroqua and a third language. Shaking his head he turned to Taianita, who tried a few words in Caddo.</p>
<p class="para-p">The general stood impassive. He did not understand.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Merda.” Pezi looked back at the gates. “We need the other man. The demon.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page138" title="138"/>
<p class="para-p">Demon? Were not the Mongols all demons? Despite the tension of the moment, Marcellinus laughed with a slight edge of hysteria. He could not help it. None of this made sense. Was he delirious?</p>
<p class="para-p">Perhaps the Mongol general saw Marcellinus’s laughter as disrespect. He stepped forward, his eyes murderous, and once again raised his boot.</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi boldly moved between Marcellinus and the general with his eyes lowered, raised his arms, and in the hand-talk of the Plains gestured, <em class="char-i">Back, stop, please, we talk, we beg, we beg</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">Jebei Noyon halted, and his hands danced in a few quick hand-talk gestures of his own. <em class="char-i">Show respect. Kneel or die.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">“Gaius? Straight face, no laugh, and kneel if you want to live.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita pushed at him roughly. Marcellinus struggled onto his knees, gasping at the pain. Pezi pushed his head down, almost into the ground. Marcellinus frowned at the dirt and pebbles beneath him, leaning against Taianita and trying to breathe.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hand-talk? Was it so obvious that they had almost missed it and nearly died as a result? Perhaps there was no reason why they should have guessed a Mongol would know it, even a Mongol who had been in Nova Hesperia for several years.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Ah, I see the demon,” Pezi said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Demon?” Marcellinus said into the ground.</p>
<p class="para-p">They let him up, and again he was racked with so much dizziness that he thought he might retch. He closed his eyes, opened them, and saw he was bleeding again. “Pezi, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“A warrior chief from the northwest, allied with the Mongols.” Pezi was looking back toward Yupkoyvi. His movements were calm and assured, but knowing Pezi as he did, Marcellinus could see the deep fear in his eyes that he was trying to hide. “There he is. He is Tlin-Kit.”</p>
<p class="para-p">An extraordinary figure was walking toward them from the direction of the Great House. Covering his head was a wooden helmet with a full face mask on which was carved the face of a demon. The mask had bright copper eyebrows and was decorated with what might be real human hair. He wore armor of thick animal hide, fastened with wooden toggles and decorated with small metal disks. As the man approached, they saw that the disks were all of a uniform size, with square holes in the center. “Jin coins,” muttered one of the legionaries.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page139" title="139"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus would have thought Tlin-Kit a shaman if not for the thick wooden club with a wicked bone hook he carried in his right hand and the two severed Yupkoyvi heads that hung by their hair from his left. The heads knocked together obscenely, dripping blood. “Holy Jove.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The same legionary spit. “Fucking barbarian.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Easy, trooper,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">The warrior pushed his helmet up as he approached, which had the bizarre effect of making him appear to have two faces stacked one above the other. He said something guttural.</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi bowed deeply yet again. “Tlin-Kit.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had to admit that Pezi’s courage had grown. Anyone who could face fearsome warriors like Jebei Noyon and Tlin-Kit and calmly speak words in several different languages deserved Marcellinus’s respect.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tlin-Kit spared Pezi only a glance, then surveyed the prisoners. He spoke again, and Marcellinus recognized it as rough and strongly accented Algon-Quian.</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi responded in the same language, bowing and gesturing. Jebei Noyon and Tlin-Kit talked in Mongol, and then the warrior from the northwest spoke to Pezi again.</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi drew himself up and spoke in Latin. “Here is Jebei Noyon, one of the foremost generals of the Mongol Khan. Jebei wants to know which of you two rules here. But I fear that he might keep that chief alive and kill the other. So I say to him: both of you, you and Bassus. He asks again, which? I say both.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Futete.” Bassus was sweating and breathing hard, his voice a faint wheeze. “Save Gaius. Let the bastard kill me. I’m done for anyway.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Be strong, Decurion,” Marcellinus said. “Mongols respect strength above all else.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Shit,” said Mikasi, and looked at Hanska. If only the chiefs would be kept alive, the Cahokians were dead, too.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page140" title="140"/>
<p class="para-p">Jebei Noyon spoke again in his difficult flat speech, and the warrior Tlin-Kit again translated into his accented Algon-Quian, augmented with the hand-talk.</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi stared. He wiped sweat from his forehead and said nothing.</p>
<p class="para-p">“ ‘You will not eat,’ ” Taianita said mechanically as she translated, her brow furrowed. “ ‘You will drink no more water than the drops that will keep you alive. Your wounds can weep blood into the rocks of this desert. You are not worth mercy. You…’ ” Her voice trailed off.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus might have spoken, but it was too hard, and he did not want to risk antagonizing this Mongol general any further.</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi and Taianita were doing their best. For now, his life was in their hands.</p>
<p class="para-p">“No, no,” said Pezi, and then repeated it in hand-talk, <em class="char-i">No, no, I beg</em>. He fell onto his knees and began to speak quickly in Algon-Quian.</p>
<p class="para-p">Jebei Noyon nodded to the Mongol warrior by his side. The warrior reached down and slapped Pezi across the mouth.</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi recovered, sat up again, talked some more. Jebei Noyon said three words. They sounded dismissive. Tlin-Kit laughed cruelly and spit a short phrase in Algon-Quian. Then Jebei turned and walked away, his horse on one side and Tlin-Kit on the other. Pezi watched them go. Three Mongol warriors stayed, standing over them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus couldn’t bear it anymore. “Begging for your life, Pezi?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi wiped the blood from his mouth. “Begging for yours.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What? What did you tell them?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That you are important. That you have the ear of the Imperator of Roma.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s thoughts were coming slowly, as if swimming through mud, and for a sick moment all he could think of were the ears being hacked off by the Mongol horsemen. “What?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi clapped his hands abruptly in front of Marcellinus’s face, making him reel back in shock. “Wanageeska, wake up! I tell them that the Imperator of Roma is here in Hesperia, which they clearly know already, and that <em class="char-i">you</em> know him. That you are valuable and should be kept alive.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Pezi, Mongols do not take hostages, and Hadrianus would not pay a bent sesterce to get me back.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page141" title="141"/>
<p class="para-p">Pezi looked exasperated. “Stop arguing and thank me. For Jebei’s last words were to tell me that you Roman leaders and all the Cahokians, and perhaps the Romans that still survive, he will now spare and take to the Mongol Khan.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s heart lurched. “To the Khan? <em class="char-i">Chinggis</em> Khan?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of course. The Khan is far from here.” Pezi glanced at the retreating figure of Jebei Noyon. “The Arrow serves his chief. You may have information about Roma and Cahokia that his chief needs. So it is the Khan himself who will decree who lives and who dies.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“They’ll torture us for information?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Mongols do not torture,” Bassus muttered with difficulty.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps they do now.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well. All I know is that we must now go to the plaza of the Great House.” Pezi looked apologetic. “I am sorry, Wanageeska. We may not walk, may not even stand. We must crawl there.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Crawl?”</p>
<p class="para-p">One of the Mongols stepped forward and poked at Marcellinus’s back with his saber.</p>
<p class="para-p">“We must crawl before the Mongols.” Pezi lowered himself onto his belly. “Crawl like the worms they say we are. I am sorry.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What about him?” Hanska pointed to Bassus, outraged. “How does <em class="char-i">he</em> crawl? Fuck this shit…”</p>
<p class="para-p">She put her hands to the ground as if to stand. Two Mongol warriors shoved at her, one kicking her ankles.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hanska, Hanska!” Mikasi was already down, shaking his head at her in warning. “Do not anger them. Please. Join me down here.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We will help Bassus between us,” Pezi said. “Hanska, if you are dead, you can help no one. Please?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Futete.” Hanska dropped onto the ground by Bassus’s side. “All right. Let’s go.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">It was an hour before they arrived at the gates of Yupkoyvi, easing the lead decurion along the ground between them with agonizing slowness.</p>
<p class="para-p">Appearing gradually before them as they entered the plaza was a mound of corpses.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page142" title="142"/>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols were sweeping the Great House from end to end, marching through each level in groups of twenty. Many dozens of the Hand had tried to hide in the rooms, kivas, and storage pits of Yupkoyvi. Now they were being dragged out into the open air, there to be slain swiftly by a sword blade to the throat and their amputated ears added to the Mongols’ grisly collection. It was a systematic, heartless slaughter.</p>
<p class="para-p">In addition, the Thousand-Thousand were stockpiling food, turquoise, obsidian, copper, furs, feathers, anything that might be of use or value. They seemed to take no pleasure or sorrow in their work. They were merely men following orders with a calm and chilling efficiency.</p>
<p class="para-p">And there was Enopay on his hands and knees, too, his eyes red, his arms bloodied. “Fuck you, Mongol warrior! Fuck you!” Again he tried to rise; again the Mongol standing over him shoved him back down into the dirt with his boot.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols were slaying the women and children of Yupkoyvi with as little compunction as the men. Enopay was still alive only because he was Cahokian, and at any moment the hard-bitten Mongol looming over him could decide he was too noisy to be worth the trouble. “Enopay, stay down! I’m coming!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Gaius!” Enopay dropped to the plaza floor, put his palm up to his forehead, and stared wide-eyed. He obviously had not expected to see Marcellinus alive again. “Merda, merda…”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Where is Kanuna?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Over there. I was trying to go to him. They struck him very hard.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Yes, Kanuna was sprawled out on the ground some hundred feet away, his face covered in blood and his arms and legs untidy, like a broken doll.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Kanuna!” Heedless of the danger, Taianita pushed herself up and made as if to hurry across the plaza to the stricken elder.</p>
<p class="para-p">A Mongol grabbed her by the hair and yanked her back. Taianita resisted, trying to kick him, but the Mongol warrior swung his elbow into her jaw. She fell over Marcellinus’s legs and went down hard, unconscious. The Mongol bestrode her, studying her, his saber in his hand and his eyes cold.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page143" title="143"/>
<p class="para-p">From the ground Pezi started talking quickly in Algon-Quian, although this Mongol could not possibly have understood. Pezi ducked his head, bowing repeatedly. The warrior kicked him, looking disgusted, but left Taianita where she lay.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay covered his face. “No, no, no, no…”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus crawled to the boy as quickly as he was humanly able, tearing whatever skin was left off his forearms and knees and leaving a trail of blood across the plaza. “Enopay, hush, be still.” He wrapped his arms around the boy, and Hanska and Mikasi crawled to them and held them both, in the dirt under the baking sun, as the Mongol soldier loomed over them with his deadly spear in his hand and the massacre of the Yupkoyvi continued around them.</p></div></body></html>

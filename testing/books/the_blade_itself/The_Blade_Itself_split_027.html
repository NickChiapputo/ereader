<div id="filepos720501" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Barbarians at the Gate</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal flashed along the lane beside the moat, feet pounding on the worn cobblestones, the great white wall sliding endlessly by on his right, one tower after another, as he made his daily circuit of the Agriont. Since he had cut down on the drinking the improvement in his stamina had been impressive. He was scarcely even out of breath. It was early and the streets of the city were nearly empty. The odd person would look up at him as he ran by, maybe even call out some word of encouragement, but Jezal barely noticed them. His eyes were fixed on the sparkling, lapping water in the moat, and his mind was elsewhere.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ardee. Where else was it ever? He had supposed, after that day when West had warned him off, after he had stopped seeing her, that his thoughts would soon return to other matters, and other women. He had applied himself to his fencing with a will, attempted to show an interest in his duties as an officer, but he found himself unable to concentrate, and other women seemed now pale, flat, tedious creatures. The long runs, the monotonous exercises with bar and beam, gave his mind ample opportunity to wander. The tedium of peacetime soldiering was even worse: reading boring papers, standing guard on things that needed no guarding. His attention would inevitably slip, and then she would be there.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ardee in wholesome peasant garb, flushed and sweaty from hard work in the fields. Ardee in the finery of a princess, glittering with jewels. Ardee bathing in forest pools, while he watched from the bushes. Ardee proper and demure, glancing shyly up at him from beneath her lashes. Ardee a whore by the docks, beckoning to him from a grimy doorway. The fantasies were infinite in variety, but they all ended the same way.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">His hour-long circuit of the Agriont was complete and he thumped across the bridge and back in through the south gate.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal treated the guards to their daily share of indifference, trotted through the tunnel and up the long ramp into the fortress, then turned towards the courtyard where Marshal Varuz would be waiting. All the while, Ardee was rubbing up against the back of his mind.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was hardly as though he had nothing else to think about. The Contest was close now, very close. Soon he would fight before the cheering crowds, his family and friends among them. It might make his reputation… or sink it. He should have been lying awake at night, tense and sweating, worrying endlessly about forms, and training, and steels. And yet somehow that wasn’t what he thought about in bed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Then there was a war on. It was easy to forget, here in the sunny lanes of the Agriont, that Angland had been invaded by hordes of slavering barbarians. He would be going north soon, to lead his company in battle. There, surely, was a thought to keep a man occupied. Was not war a deadly business? He could be hurt, or scarred, or killed even. Jezal tried to conjure up the twisting, twitching, painted face of Fenris the Feared. Legions of screaming savages descending upon the Agriont. It was a terrible business alright, a dangerous and frightening business.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Hmmm.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ardee came from Angland. What if, say, she were to fall into the hands of the Northmen? Jezal would rush to her rescue, of course. She would not be hurt. Well, not badly. Perhaps her clothes a little torn, like so? No doubt she would be frightened, grateful. He would be obliged to comfort her, of course. She might even faint? He might have to carry her, her head pressed against his shoulder. He might have to lay her down and loosen her clothes. Their lips might touch, just brush gently, hers might part a little, then…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal stumbled in the road. There was a pleasant swelling building in his crotch. Pleasant, but hardly compatible with a brisk run. He was nearly at the courtyard now, and this would never do at fencing practice. He glanced desperately around for a distraction, and nearly choked on his tongue. Major West was standing by the wall, dressed to fence and watching him approach with an unusually grim expression. For an instant, Jezal wondered if his friend might be able to tell what he had been thinking. He swallowed guiltily, felt the blood rushing to his face. West couldn’t know, he couldn’t. But he was most unhappy about something.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Luthar,” he grunted.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“West.” Jezal stared down at his shoes. They had not been getting on too well since West joined Lord Marshal Burr’s staff. Jezal tried to be happy for him, but could not escape the feeling that he was better qualified for the post. He had excellent blood after all, whether he had experience in the field or not. Then Ardee was still lurking between them, that unpleasant and needless warning. Everyone knew that West had been first through the breach at Ulrioch. Everyone knew that he had the devil of a temper. That had always seemed exciting to Jezal, until he got on the wrong end of it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Varuz is waiting.” West unfolded his arms and strode off towards the archway, “and he’s not alone.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not alone?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Marshal feels you need to get used to an audience.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal frowned. “I’m surprised anyone cares in the present climate, what with the war and all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’d be surprised. Fighting and fencing and all things martial are very much the flavour. Everyone’s wearing a sword these days, even if they’ve never drawn one in their lives. There’s an absolute fever about the Contest, believe me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal blinked as they passed into the bright courtyard. A stand of temporary seating had been hastily erected along one wall, packed from one end to the other with people, three score or more.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And here he is!” shouted Marshal Varuz. There was a ripple of polite applause. Jezal felt himself grinning—there were some very important people in amongst the crowd. He spotted Marovia, the Lord High Justice, stroking his long beard. Lord Isher was not far away from him, looking slightly bored. Crown Prince Ladisla himself was lounging on the front row, shining in a shirt of gossamer chain-mail and clapping enthusiastically. The people on the benches behind had to lean over to see round the waving plume on his magnificent hat.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Varuz handed Jezal his steels, still beaming. “Don’t you dare make me look a fool!” he hissed. Jezal coughed nervously, looking up at the rows of expectant people. His heart sank. Inquisitor Glokta’s toothless grin leered at him from the crowd, and on the row behind him… Ardee West. She was wearing an expression that she never had in his daydreams: one third sullen, one third accusing, one third simply bored. He glanced away, staring toward the opposite wall, inwardly cursing his own cowardice. He seemed unable to meet anyone’s eye these days.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“This bout will be fought with half-edged steels!” thundered the Lord Marshal. “The best of three touches!” West already had his swords drawn and was making his way to the circle, marked out with white chalk in the carefully shaved grass. Jezal’s heart was hammering loud as he fumbled his own steels out of their sheaths, acutely aware of all those eyes upon him. He took his mark opposite West, pushing his feet cautiously into the grass. West raised his steels, Jezal did the same. They faced each other for a moment, motionless.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Begin!” shouted Varuz.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It quickly became clear that West had no mind to roll over for him. He came on with more than his usual ferocity, harrying Jezal with a flurry of heavy cuts, their steels clashing and scraping rapidly together. He gave ground, still uncomfortable under the watchful eyes of all those people, damned important people some of them, but as West pushed him back towards the edge of the circle, his nerves began to fade, his training took over. He ducked away, making room for himself, parrying the cuts with left and right, dodging and dancing, too fast to catch.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The people faded, even Ardee was gone. The blades moved by themselves, back and forth, up and down. There was no need for him to look at them. He turned his attention to Wests eyes, watched them flicker from the ground to the steels to Jezal’s dancing feet, trying to guess his intentions.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He felt the lunge coming even before it was begun. He feinted one way then turned the other, slipping smoothly round behind West as he blundered past. It was a simple matter for him to apply his foot to the seat of his opponent’s trousers and shove him out of the circle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A touch!” shouted Marshal Varuz.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a ripple of laughter as the Major sprawled on his face. “A touch on the arse!” guffawed the Crown Prince, his plume waving back and forth with merriment. “One to Captain Luthar!” West didn’t look half so intimidating with his face in the dirt. Jezal gave a little bow to the audience, risked a smile in Ardee’s direction as he rose. He was disappointed to see she wasn’t even looking at him. She was watching her brother struggle in the dust with a faint, cruel grin.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West got slowly to his feet. “A good touch,” he muttered through gritted teeth as he stepped back into the circle. Jezal took his own mark, barely able to suppress his smile.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Begin!” shouted Varuz.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West came on strongly again, but Jezal was warming to his task now. The sounds of the audience muttered and swelled as he danced this way and that. He began to work the odd flourish into his movements, and the onlookers responded, “oohs” and “aahs” floating up as he flicked West’s efforts away. He had never fenced so well, never moved so smoothly. The bigger man was starting to tire a little, the snap was going out of his cuts. Their long steels clashed together, scraped. Jezal twisted his right wrist and tore West’s blade from his fingers, stepped in and slashed at him with his left.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gah!” West winced and dropped his short steel, hopping away and grabbing his forearm. A few drops of blood pattered across the ground.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Two to nothing!” shouted Varuz.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Crown Prince jumped up, his hat tumbling off, delighted by the sight of blood. “Excellent!” he squawked, “capital!” Others joined him on their feet, clapping loudly. Jezal basked in their approval, smiling wide, every muscle tingling with happiness. He understood now what he had been training for.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well fought, Jezal,” muttered West, a trickle of blood running down his forearm. “You’ve got too good for me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Sorry about the cut.” Jezal grinned. He wasn’t sorry in the least.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It’s nothing. Just a scratch.” West strode away, frowning and holding his wrist. Nobody paid much attention to his exit, Jezal least of all. Sporting events are all about the winners.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Lord Marovia was the first to get up from the benches and offer his congratulations. “What a promising young man,” he said, smiling warmly at Jezal, “but do you think he can beat Bremer dan Gorst?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Varuz gave Jezal a fatherly clap on the shoulder. “I’m sure he can beat anyone, on the right day”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hmm. Have you seen Gorst fence?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No, though I hear he is most impressive.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, indeed—he is a devil.” The High Justice raised his bushy eyebrows. “I look forward to seeing them meet. Have you ever considered a career in the law, Captain Luthar?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal was taken by surprise. “Er, no, your Worship, that is… I am a soldier.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course you are. But battles and so forth can play hell with the nerves. If you should ever change your mind, perhaps I might have a place for you. I can always find a use for promising men.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Er, thank you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Until the Contest then. Good luck, Captain,” he threw over his shoulder as he shuffled away. The implication was that he thought Jezal would need a great deal of it. His Highness Prince Ladisla was more optimistic.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re my man, Luthar!” he shouted, poking the air with his fingers as though they were fencing steels. “I’m going to double my bet on you!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal bowed obsequiously. “Your Highness is too kind.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re my man! A soldier! A fencing man should fight for his country, eh, Varuz? Why isn’t this Gorst a soldier?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I believe he is, your Highness,” said the Lord Marshal gently. “He is a kinsman of Lord Brock, and serves with his personal guard.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh.” The Prince seemed confused for a moment, but soon perked up. “But you’re my man!” he shouted at Jezal, poking once more with his fingers, the feather on his hat waving this way and that. “You’re the man for me!” He danced off towards the archway, decorative chain-mail gleaming.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Very impressive.” Jezal whipped round, took an ungainly step back. Glokta, leering at him from his blind side. For a cripple, he had an uncanny knack of sneaking up on a man. “What a happy chance for everyone that you didn’t give it up after all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I never had any intention of doing so,” snapped Jezal frostily.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta sucked at his gums. “If you say so, Captain.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I do.” Jezal turned rudely away, hoping that he never had occasion to speak to the loathsome man again. He found himself staring straight into Ardee’s face, no more than a foot away.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gah,” he stammered, stepping back again.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Jezal,” she said, “I haven’t seen you in a while.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Er…” He glanced nervously around. Glokta was shambling away. West was long gone. Varuz was busy holding forth to Lord Isher and a few others still remaining in the courtyard. They were unobserved. He had to speak to her. He ought to tell her straight out that he could not see her anymore. He owed her that much. “Er…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Nothing to say to me?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Er…” He turned swiftly on his heel and walked away, his shoulders prickling with shame.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The tedium of guard duty at the south gate seemed, after all that unexpected excitement, almost a mercy. Jezal was quite looking forward to standing idly by, watching people file in and out of the Agriont, listening to Lieutenant Kaspa’s mindless babble. At least, he was until he got there.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Kaspa and the usual complement of armoured soldiers were clustered around the outer gates, where the old bridge across the moat passed between the two massive, white rendered towers of the gatehouse. As Jezal marched down to the end of the long tunnel he saw that there was someone with them. A small, harassed-looking fellow wearing spectacles. Jezal recognised him vaguely. Morrow he was called, some crony of the Lord Chamberlain. He had no reason to be here.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Captain Luthar, what a happy chance!” Jezal jumped. It was that lunatic, Sulfur, sitting cross-legged on the ground behind him, his back against the sheer wall of the gatehouse.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What the hell’s he doing here?” snapped Jezal. Kaspa opened his mouth to speak, but Sulfur got in first.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Don’t mind me, Captain, I’m simply waiting for my master.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Your master?” He dreaded to think what manner of an idiot this idiot might serve.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Indeed. He should be here very shortly.” Sulfur frowned up at the sun. “He is already somewhat tardy, if the truth be told.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Really?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes.” The madman broke into a friendly smile once more. “But he’ll be along, Jezal, you can depend on it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">First-name terms was too much to take. He hardly knew the man, and what he knew he didn’t like. He opened his mouth to give him a piece of his mind, but Sulfur suddenly jumped up, grabbing his stick from the wall and brushing himself down.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Here they are!” he said, looking out across the moat. Jezal followed the idiot’s eyes with his own.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A magnificent old man was striding purposefully across the bridge, bald head held high, a fabulous gown of shimmering red and silver flowing about him in the breeze. At his heels came a sickly-looking youth, head a little bowed as if in awe of the older man, holding a long staff out before him in upturned palms. A great brute of a man in a heavy fur cloak followed behind them, a good half head taller than the other two.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What the…” Jezal trailed off. He seemed to recognise the old man from somewhere. Some lord perhaps, from the Open Council? Some foreign ambassador? Certainly he had an air of majesty. Jezal racked his brains as they approached, but could not place him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man stopped before the gatehouse, swept Jezal, Kaspa, Morrow and the guards imperiously with glittering green eyes. “Yoru,” he said.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sulfur stepped forward, bowing low. “Master Bayaz,” he murmured, in hushed tones of deep respect.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">And that was it. That was why Jezal knew the man. He bore a definite resemblance to the statue of Bayaz in the Kingsway. The statue Jezal had run past so many times. A little fatter perhaps, but that expression: stern, wise, effortlessly commanding, was just the same. Jezal frowned. For the old man to be called by that name? He didn’t like it. He didn’t like the look of the lanky young man with the staff either. He liked the look of the old man’s other companion even less.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West had often told Jezal that the Northmen found in Adua, usually skulking dishevelled by the docks or dirty drunk in gutters, were by no means typical of their people. Those that lived free in the far North, fighting, feuding, feasting, and doing whatever Northmen did, were of quite a different kind. A tall, fierce, handsome people, Jezal had always imagined, with a touch of romance about them. Strong, yet graceful. Wild, yet noble. Savage, yet cunning. The kind of men whose eyes are fixed always on the far horizon.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">This was not one of those.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Never in his life had Jezal seen a more brutish-looking man. Even Fenris the Feared had seemed civilised by comparison. His face was like a whipped back, criss-crossed with ragged scars.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">His nose was bent, pointing off a little sideways. One ear had a big notch out of it, one eye seemed a touch higher than the other, surrounded by a crescent-shaped wound. His whole face, in fact, was slightly beaten, broken, lop-sided, like that of a prize fighter who has fought a few bouts too many. His expression too, was that of one punch-drunk. He gawped up at the gatehouse, forehead furrowed, mouth hanging open, staring about him with a look of near animal stupidity.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He wore a long fur cloak, and a leather tunic set with gold, but this height of barbaric splendour only made him look more savage, and there was no missing the long, heavy sword at his belt. The Northman scratched at a big pink scar through the stubble on his cheek as he peered up at the sheer walls above, and Jezal noticed one of his fingers was missing. As though any further evidence of a life of violence and savagery was necessary.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">To let this hulking primitive into the Agriont? While they were at war with the Northmen? It was unthinkable! But Morrow was already sidling forward. “The Lord Chamberlain is expecting you, gentlemen,” he gushed as he bowed and scraped his way towards the old man, “if you would care to follow me—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“One moment.” Jezal grabbed the under-secretary by the elbow and pulled him aside. “Him too?” he asked incredulously, nodding over at the primitive in the cloak. “We are at war, you know!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Lord Hoff was most specific!” Morrow shook his arm free, spectacles flashing. “Keep him here if you wish, but you can explain it to the Lord Chamberlain!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal swallowed. That idea was not at all appealing. He glanced up at the old man, but could not look him in the eye for long. He had a mysterious air, an air of knowing something no one else could guess, and it was most unsettling.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You… must… leave… your… weapons… here!” he shouted, speaking as slowly and clearly as possible.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Happy to.” The Northman pulled the sword from his belt and held it out. It weighed heavily in Jezal’s hands: a big, plain, brutal-looking weapon. He followed it with a long knife, then knelt and pulled another from his boot. He took a third from the small of his back, and then produced a thin blade from inside his sleeve, heaping them into Jezal’s outstretched arms. The Northman smiled broadly. It was truly a hideous sight, the ragged scars twisting and puckering, making his face more lopsided than ever.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You can never have too many knives,” he growled in a deep, grinding voice. Nobody laughed, but he did not seem to care.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shall we go?” asked the old man.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Without delay,” said Morrow, turning to leave.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’ll come with you.” Jezal dumped his armload of weapons into Kaspa’s hands.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That really isn’t necessary, Captain,” whined Morrow.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I insist.” Once he was delivered to the Lord Chamberlain, the Northman could murder whomever he pleased: it would be someone else’s problem. But until he got there Jezal might be blamed for whatever mischief he got up to, and he was damned if he was going to let that happen.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The guards stood aside, the strange procession passed through the gate. Morrow was first, whispering obsequious nothings over his shoulder to the old man in the splendid robe. The pale youth was next, followed by Sulfur. The nine-fingered Northman lumbered along at the back.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal followed with his thumb in his belt, close to the hilt of his sword so he could get to it quickly, watching the savage intently for any sudden moves. After following him for a short while though, Jezal had to admit, the man gave no appearance of having murder in mind. If anything he looked curious, bemused, and somewhat embarrassed. He kept slowing, staring up at the buildings around him, shaking his head, scratching his face, muttering under his breath. He would occasionally horrify passers-by by smiling at them, but he seemed to present no greater threat and Jezal began to relax, at least until they reached the Square of Marshals.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Northman stopped suddenly. Jezal fumbled for his sword, but the primitive’s eyes were locked ahead, gazing at a fountain nearby. He moved slowly towards it, then cautiously raised a thick finger and poked at the glittering jet. Water splashed into his face and he blundered away, almost knocking Jezal down. “A spring?” he whispered. “But how?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Mercy. The man was like a child. A six and a half foot child with a face like a butcher’s block. “There are pipes!” Jezal stamped on the paving. “Beneath… the… ground!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Pipes,” echoed the primitive quietly, staring at the frothing water.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The others had moved some way ahead, close to the grand building in which Hoff had his offices. Jezal began to step away from the fountain, hoping to draw the witless savage with him. To Jezal’s relief he followed, shaking his head and muttering “pipes” to himself, over and over.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They entered the cool darkness of the Lord Chamberlain’s ante-room. There were people seated on the benches around the walls, some of them giving the impression of having been waiting a very long time. They all stared as Morrow ushered the peculiar group straight into Hoffs offices. The spectacled secretary opened the heavy double doors and stood by while first the old bald man, then his crony with the stick, then the madman Sulfur, and finally the nine-fingered primitive walked in past him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal made to follow them, but Morrow stood in the doorway and blocked his path. “Thank you so much for your help, Captain,” he said with a thin smile. “You may return to the gate.” Jezal peered over his shoulder into the room beyond. He saw the Lord Chamberlain frowning behind a long table. Arch Lector Sult was beside him, grim and suspicious. High Justice Marovia was there too, a smile on his wrinkled face. Three members of the Closed Council.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Then Morrow shut the door in his face.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_27"></div></div></body>

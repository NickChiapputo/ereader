<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">M</span>arcellinus reacted immediately, kicking his leg up and over his wood and leather saddle. He half slid, half tumbled to the ground without even knowing where the threat was coming from.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then came the loudest explosion that he had heard yet, and he was knocked off his feet and back against his horse.</p>
<p class="para-p">The horse reared, whinnying. Marcellinus was on the ground with something heavy on top of him and his horse’s hooves kicking clods of earth into the air just a few feet away. A dark shadow passed over him.</p>
<p class="para-p">From next to his ear came a screech of pain that terminated in a choking cough. Broken porcelain rained down over them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus twisted and shoved, trying to free himself. “Enopay! Enopay!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Jupiterrr…!”</p>
<p class="para-p">While the First’s attention had been drawn away by the heavy cavalry attack, a Firebird had come in fast and low and thrown a thunderclap bomb. Seeing it coming, Sollonius had flung himself in front of his Praetor and had taken the brunt of the blast.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sollonius’s armor had protected his torso from the worst of it, but he was bleeding extensively from the back of his neck, arms, and legs, and the left side of his face was a mass of blood. He writhed on the ground in his agony in an unconscious parody of the Serpent that had flown by just moments before.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page408" title="408"/>
<p class="para-p">“Aulus! Get a medicus here!”</p>
<p class="para-p">It was Enopay’s voice. In relief, Marcellinus turned to see the boy already running away—unharmed—between the columns of legionaries. Aulus stood dazed, and Enopay had obviously decided it would be quicker to run for help himself than to wait for Aulus to signal for it.</p>
<p class="para-p">Napayshni hurried to Marcellinus’s side, guilt twisting his face. “I am sorry I was not beside you, Wanageeska…”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m not.” Marcellinus looked up, scanning the skies. Sintikala and Kimimela were high above them, turning to help escort the five Wakinyan that were about to overfly the Sixth.</p>
<p class="para-p">“There, look,” Napayshni said. “The Firebird has come down in the land of no men.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No-man’s-land,” said Marcellinus, and indeed the three Firebird pilots were shucking their wing in the area between the two armies, trying to keep their heads low.</p>
<p class="para-p">It didn’t matter. A war party of six Iroqua loped toward them. The pilots turned to face the threat, and one tried to draw the bow he had slung over his shoulder, but the first three Iroqua were already slamming their clubs and axes into the Mongols’ bodies while the other three covered them, ready to ward off any enemy horsemen that might be approaching. None were. The Firebird pilots were soon dead and scalped.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m starting to like the Iroqua,” Marcellinus said, and at Napayshni’s pained expression he added quickly: “I was joking…but some are fierce fighters.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sollonius had stopped crying out now but was curled into a ball hissing air through his teeth, still bleeding profusely. Chumanee was coming at a run with Enopay trotting behind her, weaving between Romans who looked startled to see a woman on the battlefield. Marcellinus nodded at her and almost threw himself on the ground again when he heard a detonation behind him.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was the <em class="char-i">whump</em> of Cahokian liquid fire. The leftmost of the Sky Lanterns had just released a barrage onto the trebuchets. He saw the familiar red and white flames and the oily cloud rising up, heard the cries and screams of men doused in the agonizing incendiary.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page409" title="409"/>
<p class="para-p">A Thunderbird passed over him and almost immediately began to spray the Chisel column with liquid flame—a little too soon, as part of the Roman front line got spattered. Foul words howled in Latin turned to cheers as the Mongol heavies broke off their attack and scattered away.</p>
<p class="para-p">For a few brief, miraculous moments, the Sixth Legion’s front line was unassailed. “Forward!” Marcellinus shouted. “Cornicen, sound the advance! Take ground!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Freed of the weight of much of its load of liquid fire, the first Sky Lantern rose dramatically in the air. By this time Marcellinus was actually learning something from his aerial reconnaissance crews: from an Eagle, Taianita was signaling down to Enopay, who quickly relayed the information.</p>
<p class="para-p">The second Sky Lantern was overflying the Mongol camp, targeting the crude corral where the Mongols were keeping most of their remounts and the wagons that carried their black powder bombs. The third was conducting a literal scorched-earth policy and setting fire to what remained of the grass along the right side of the camp, bringing ruin to the two-mile-long stretch of open runway that the Mongol horsemen had been using to haul their Firebirds and Feathered Serpents aloft and managing to destroy several of the flying craft on the ground. Once their missions were over, the Sky Lanterns climbed higher into the sky and kept going into the west.</p>
<p class="para-p">Right now, there were no Mongol craft in the air and the jaghuns responsible for launching them were scurrying to regroup. Marcellinus hoped they would not get the chance.</p>
<p class="para-p">The assault of the Sky Lanterns had rendered the skies safe for the Thunderbirds, and the huge aerial craft were making the most of the opportunity. The first two Thunderbirds were spraying Mongol horsemen in the field with liquid flame, with variable results—the cavalry were too spread out, too mobile, and too well armored to suffer as badly from the liquid fire as infantry and civilians did, but the Wakinyan certainly put a crimp in the Mongols’ maneuverability. The third Wakinyan diverted once its pilots saw the damage the trebuchets had sustained from the Sky Lantern attack and instead flew on over the Mongol camp, saturation bombing the central area where the Keshik tents surrounded the great yurt of the Mongol Khan and burning more of the supply wagons in the rear of the camp, along with the unfortunate oxen that had hauled the wagons across the continent.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page410" title="410"/>
<p class="para-p">Turning sharply right, those Wakinyan were able to fly over the Wemissori before having to land. The fourth and fifth Thunderbirds had disappeared off through the Jin salt smoke and haze to the right, presumably to menace the central grouping of trebuchets that threatened the Legio III Parthica.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now Aelfric led his detachment of legionaries from the Sixth and Seventh Cohorts forward to assault the trebuchet towers that remained unburned and mop up the Mongols who manned them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Once the Wakinyan were past, the Mongol light cavalry set about organizing itself in broad lines for another wave attack on the Sixth. It was clear that they lacked some of the vigor they had shown earlier in the war and that the aerial assaults were having an effect on the Mongols’ morale. Capitalizing on that, Marcellinus sent the joint force of the Ninth Syrian and Hanska’s Third Cahokian back into the field in a hit-and-run attack to break them up, then marched his legion forward another hundred feet.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Damn this smoke,” he said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Your other Roman battles had no smoke?” Takoda was guarding Marcellinus now, his eyes flickering nervously from the battle line to the skies, from behind him to in front of him and over to his right. Aulus and Furnius had moved to the back to prepare dispatches to send to the Imperator. Enopay had gone off to the area they were using as a hospital with Sollonius and Chumanee, and Napayshni was busy sending runners back and forth to the tribunes of the Sixth to receive their reports.</p>
<p class="para-p">Of course, there was no reason Takoda should know about Roman battles. “These are my first battles where the enemy has the exploding black powder. Nor have any of my previous opponents thrown buckets of stinking pitch.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh.” Takoda’s eyebrows shot up. “Then you are doing quite well.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page411" title="411"/>
<p class="para-p">“Thank you. Although it’s mostly because of you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">That was true enough. The Sixth was taking casualties, but not at an unacceptable level. Its cohorts were standing firm and fighting with calm efficiency. But it was Cahokian ingenuity and bravery that had made all the difference. The valor of the Hawk and Thunderbird clans had mostly negated the threat from their enemies’ Firebirds and Feathered Serpents as well as considerably disrupting their cavalry charges. The aerial attacks with the Cahokian liquid flame had disabled the Mongols’ siege engines, strafed their camp and killed or stampeded many of their remounts, and helped prevent further Firebird launches.</p>
<p class="para-p">And then there were the Hesperian foot soldiers. Rather than fight like Romans, the braves of the First Cahokian were fighting like Hesperians, joining the Blackfoot, Iroqua, and Wolf Warriors in running around in ruthless and agile war parties to sow death and confusion among Chagatai’s light horse archers.</p>
<p class="para-p">A sheet of fire leaped into the sky far to Marcellinus’s right. He hoped that would be one of the remaining Thunderbirds dropping its fiery load over the central grouping of Mongol trebuchets. Almost absently, Marcellinus noted that Aelfric’s cohorts had moved back to join the rest of the Ironclads.</p>
<p class="para-p">For a brief moment he allowed himself to hope that the worst of all this was over, that they were finally gaining the upper hand over the forces of the Mongol Khan.</p>
<p class="para-p">A short cornu blast came from behind him: not a signal but someone trying to get his attention. Marcellinus turned to find five men riding up behind him: Aurelius Dizala, the adjutant Aulus, Isleifur Bjarnason, Einar Stenberg, and a signalman bearing a cornu. None looked elated at the successes of the Sixth. “Juno. What?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We’re fucked,” Aulus said, ever economical with information.</p>
<p class="para-p">Exasperated, Marcellinus looked instead at Aurelius Dizala.</p>
<p class="para-p">“The 27th has broken,” Dizala said tersely. “Bjarnason?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Viking dismounted in a single swift movement. “They pushed forward too hard. Cohorts got split. Then the Mongols broke and fled toward the Wemissori, and the Fourth Polovtsian chased them, with three cohorts of the 27th Augustan in hot pursuit. It was a trick, of course. The Yokot’an Maya swept in to cut them off, then the Mongols turned on them. Circled them into a tight crush and dropped thunder crash bombs into them with Feathered Serpents. Drove the rest into the Wemissori, where the Tlingit were waiting in force in canoes to hack them to death in the water. Bloodbath.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page412" title="412"/>
<p class="para-p">“Futete. His other cohorts?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“When I left, Agrippa had pulled them south to latch on to the Third Parthica.”</p>
<p class="para-p">A chill began at the base of Marcellinus’s spine and wormed its way upward. “Leaving the right field wide open?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Bjarnason nodded. “We’re flanked. Many thousands of warriors under Jebei Noyon are pouring around our right side. Don’t know yet whether they’ll target the Third Parthica or come all the way around to hit us in the rear.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Either way they can take out our launch towers and maybe cut us off from Forward Camp. Where’s Hadrianus?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Bjarnason shook his head and pointed to Einar Stenberg, who took up the tale. “Since the charge, Sabinus’s Third Parthica has been fighting a steady battle of attrition against Badahur’s forces. Slow and cautious.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Shock me again,” Aurelius Dizala muttered.</p>
<p class="para-p">Takoda raised his hand and interrupted. “Our Mongols are moving out.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus swung himself up into the saddle to see over the men in front of him. It was true. The heavy cavalry of Chagatai that had previously been assaulting the Sixth was regrouping in front of their burning camp, but some mingghans were already moving north. The horse archers had split into two. One group was cantering north with all due speed, and the remainder had lined up to form a wall to keep the heavies secure, their horses panting and ducking their heads in a futile attempt to find forage in the hacked-up mud beneath them. All attacks on the Roman line had ceased.</p>
<p class="para-p">Scattered cheers were breaking out in his cohorts. They had no idea what was really happening. They weren’t going to be so thrilled when they found out.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page413" title="413"/>
<p class="para-p">“They haven’t suffered much from the air,” Stenberg continued, still reporting on the Third Parthica. “Our Hawks held the Firebirds back, and we don’t think they can launch the Serpents anymore. The center holds. But I couldn’t see the Praetorians anywhere. They—and the Imperator—are either wrapped up deep inside the Third or falling back to castra.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had little doubt about which was the more likely. He scanned his cohorts, taking in positions, strengths, gaps in his lines. Some of his centurions had ordered their men to sit and rest while they could. In his left wing Hanska’s Third were off their horses, also taking a breather. Tahtay’s Hesperians were walking back and forth, breathing, calming down after the battle. He saw no Catanwakuwa in the air. Maybe they were back defending their launchers from the Mongols.</p>
<p class="para-p">Dizala looked at Marcellinus. “Caesar will have no safety within the Third. We must get to him, quick as we can.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded. “Can your men lead? The First Cohort has borne the brunt for the past hour.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Certainly.”</p>
<p class="para-p">For the march across to the Imperator’s position Marcellinus needed his freshest men up front and the most battle-weary in the rear. But he couldn’t leave the launch towers unprotected, not with the Mongols sweeping around the broken 27th. To Furnius he said: “Sound the signals. Second and Third Cohorts lead out to the north, battle formation.” Aelfric’s men had also seen more than their fair share of combat. The other cohorts had gotten off lightly in comparison. “Fourth and Fifth Cohorts to follow, under Paulinus. Ifer takes the Tenth and Caecina’s Eighth and Ninth back to protect the launch towers if he can. Make it clear Ifer is the ranking officer for that action. The First Cohort joins with Aelfric’s men to bring up the rear. Tahtay and the First Cahokian with us, if they can.” He was getting tired. This was quite a day. “Is that everyone?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Everyone but the Cohors Equitata.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page414" title="414"/>
<p class="para-p">“Right. The Ninth Syrian and Hanska’s Third guard our east flank to defend us in case the Mongols come in to attack. Send the signals. Dizala: go. I’ll join you presently. And march the men slowly. They need to arrive ready to fight.”</p>
<p class="para-p">His First Tribune saluted and cantered away.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked to the skies again, unsettled by Sintikala’s absence. How long had it been since he’d seen a Cahokian aerial craft at all?</p>
<p class="para-p">Well. Nothing he could do about it.</p>
<p class="para-p">The sun was only just past the meridian. Even after all this it was still only early afternoon. He blew out a long breath.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Second Cohort was already leading off. Time to go.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Takoda, go tell Appius Gallus that the First Cohort is his. Stay with them. I’ll be moving up to join Dizala. Napayshni, you’re with me. Norsemen: go to Tahtay and Wahchintonka. Make sure they understand what’s going on. Send Tahtay to me if he’s able.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Where’s Enopay?” Isleifur demanded.</p>
<p class="para-p">“With the hospital crew.” He was about to point, but damn it, the pieces of his legion had moved around so much that he couldn’t tell anymore in which direction the wounded men had been taken. “I can’t worry about that now.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Can’t worry about Enopay?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus passed a hand over his eyes. Holy Jove. “All right. After you’ve talked to Tahtay, go get me a report on casualties from the hospital crew. If you find Enopay, keep him with you. Make sure he doesn’t do anything stupid. But go to Tahtay first—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Aye, got it.” Without even waiting for Marcellinus to finish, Bjarnason rode off into the organized chaos that was the Sixth Ferrata.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">As they marched north, the launch towers to their east went up in bright crackling explosions. The legions had just lost their launch capability for local air support. Ifer’s cohorts obviously had not gotten there in time.</p>
<p class="para-p">Even more smoke drifted toward them. Otherwise, the skies were still empty. Marcellinus had no idea where Sintikala might be, or Kimimela, Taianita, Sooleawa. But he had no time to dwell on that, because the Ironclads were marching straight into another hot war.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page415" title="415"/>
<p class="para-p">The flanking Mongol forces must have hit the Third Parthica from beside and behind just minutes before Marcellinus and Tahtay met up with Aurelius Dizala at the front of the Sixth’s marching line. The rear cohorts of the Third had disintegrated, and by the looks of things its front line had already been carved into two parts by relentless Mongol attack.</p>
<p class="para-p">Under pressure from three sides, Decinius Sabinus must have given the only orders he could. The Third Legion was forming up into defensive military squares, two cohorts to a square.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was not an easy maneuver. Mongol horse archers swarmed around them, wheeling into the legionaries’ exposed flanks and firing arrow after arrow. The Mongols had no reason to close for hand-to-hand combat here. With the Romans so disorganized, the havoc they could cause with a barrage of arrows at close range from horseback was quite enough. Soldiers were falling out of line to lie crumpled on the torn-up soil. Even as Marcellinus watched in horror, one cohort—Decinius’s Ninth, based on the glimpse he got of their signifer—panicked and fell apart, dooming themselves to slaughter. The Tenth Cohort beat a hasty retreat to merge up with the Fifth and Fourth behind them. As far as Marcellinus could see, the other cohorts were maintaining cohesion.</p>
<p class="para-p">Where was the Third’s tough Polovtsian cavalry? Probably still on the far side of the legion at what previously had been the front line, battling the main army of Chinggis and Subodei Badahur. Sabinus could have had no warning that his cohorts were about to face a major attack from Jebei Noyon in the rear.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Furnius: signal. Send in the Ninth Syrian to harry those horse archers.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Furnius glanced behind them. “What about the mingghans that took out the launch towers? They could still come for us.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I know. But I don’t see them. Perhaps Ifer’s men are holding them off.” Or those Mongol troopers might even now be galloping eastward to devastate Forward Camp. The camp was not defensible, of course; if attacked, its garrison would fall back to the river to protect the quinqueremes and the other matériel still aboard them. The warships were essentially floating forts and would cast off if they had to, making them almost unassailable from land. “Futete, Furnius, sound the damned signals.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page416" title="416"/>
<p class="para-p">“Sir, yes, sir…Shit.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What <em class="char-i">now</em>, soldier?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Furnius pointed. “Fire lances.”</p></div></body></html>

<div id="filepos65854" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> No Choice at All</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen woke with a painful jolt. He was lying awkwardly, head twisted against something hard, knees drawn up towards his chest. He opened his eyes a bleary crack. It was dark, but there was a faint glow coming from somewhere. Light through snow.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Panic stabbed at him. He knew where he was now. He’d piled some snow in the entrance to the tiny cave, to try and keep in the warmth, such as it was. It must have snowed while he was sleeping, and sealed him in. If the fall had been a heavy one there could be a lot of snow out there. Drifts deeper than a man was tall. He might never get out. He could have climbed all the way up out of the high valleys just to die in a hole in the rock, too cramped for him to even stretch out his legs.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen twisted round in the narrow space as best he could, dug away at the snow with his numb hands, floundering at it, grappling with it, hacking through it, mouthing breathless curses to himself. Light spilled in suddenly, searing bright. He shoved the last of the snow out of the way and dragged himself through into the open air.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The sky was a brilliant blue, the sun was blazing overhead. He turned his face towards it, closed his stinging eyes and let the light wash over him. The air was painful cold in his throat. Cutting cold. His mouth was dry as dust, his tongue a piece of wood, badly carved. He scooped up snow and shoved it into his mouth. It melted, he swallowed. Cold, it made his head hurt.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a graveyard stink coming from somewhere. Not just his own damp and sour sweat smell, though that was bad enough. It was the blanket, starting to rot. He had two pieces of it wrapped round his hands like mittens, tied round his wrists with twine, another round his head, like a dirty, foul-smelling hood. His boots were stuffed tight with it. The rest was wrapped round and round his body, under his coat. It smelled bad, but it had saved his life last night, and that was a good trade to Logen’s mind. It would stink a good deal more before he could afford to get rid of it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He floundered to his feet and stared about. A narrow valley, steep sided and choked with snow. Three great peaks surrounded it, piles of dark grey stone and white snow against the blue sky. He knew them. Old friends, in fact. The only ones he had left. He was up in the High Places. The roof of the world. He was safe.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Safe,” he croaked to himself, but without much joy. Safe from food, certainly. Safe from warmth, without a doubt. Neither of those things would be troubling him up here. He’d escaped the Shanka, maybe, but this was a place for the dead, and if he stayed he’d be joining them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was brutal hungry as it was. His belly was a great, painful hole that called to him with piercing cries. He fumbled in his pack for the last strip of meat. An old, brown, greasy thing like a dry twig. That would hardly fill the gap, but it was all he had. He tore at it with his teeth, tough as old boot leather, and choked it down with some snow.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen shielded his eyes with his arm and looked northward down the valley, the way he’d come the day before. The ground dropped slowly away, snow and rock giving way to the pine-covered fells of the high valleys, trees giving way to a crinkled strip of grazing land, grassy hills giving way to the sea, a sparkling line on the far horizon. Home. The thought of it made Logen feel sick.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Home. That was where his family was. His father—wise and strong, a good man, a good leader to his people. His wife, his children. They were a good family. They deserved a better son, a better husband, a better father. His friends were there too. Old and new together. It would be good to see them all again, very good. To speak to his father in the long hall. To play with his children, to sit with his wife by the river. To talk of tactics with Threetrees. To hunt with the Dogman in the high valleys, crashing through the forest with a spear, laughing like a fool.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen felt a sudden painful longing. He nearly choked on the pain of it. Trouble was, they were all dead. The hall was a ring of black splinters, the river a sewer. He’d never forget coming over the hill, seeing the burnt-out ruin in the valley below. Crawling through the ashes, fumbling for signs that someone got away, while the Dogman pulled at his shoulder and told him to give it up. Nothing but corpses, rotted past knowing. He was done looking for signs. They were all dead as the Shanka could make them, and that was dead for sure. He spat in the snow, brown spit from the dry meat. Dead and cold and rotted, or burned to ashes. Gone back to the mud.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen set his jaw and clenched his fists under the rotten shreds of blanket. He could go back to the ruins of the village by the sea, just one last time. He could charge down with a fighting roar in his throat, the way he had done at Carleon, when he’d lost a finger and won a reputation. He could put a few Shanka out of the world. Split them like he’d split Shama Heartless, shoulder to guts so his insides fell out. He could get vengeance for his father, his wife, his children, his friends. That would be a fitting end for the one they called the Bloody-Nine. To die killing. That might be a song worth the singing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But at Carleon he’d been young and strong, and with his friends behind him. Now he was weak, and hungry, and alone as could be. He’d killed Shama Heartless with a long sword, sharp as anything. He looked down at his knife. It might be a good one, but he’d get precious little vengeance with it. And who’d sing the song anyway? The Shanka had poor singing voices and worse imaginations, if they even recognised the stinking beggar in the blanket after they’d shot him full of arrows. Perhaps the vengeance could wait, at least until he had a bigger blade to work with. You have to be realistic, after all.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">South then, and become a wanderer. There was always work for a man with his skills. Hard work perhaps, and dark, but work all the same. There was an appeal in it, he had to admit. To have no one depending on him but himself, for his decisions to hold no importance, for no one’s life or death to be in his hands. He had enemies in the south, that was a fact. But the Bloody-Nine had dealt with enemies before.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He spat again. Now that he had some spit he thought he might make the most of it. It was about all he did have—spit, an old pot, and some stinking bits of blanket. Dead in the north or alive in the south. That was what it came down to, and that was no choice at all.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">You carry on. That’s what he’d always done. That’s the task that comes with surviving, whether you deserve to live or not. You remember the dead as best you can. You say some words for them. Then you carry on, and you hope for better.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen took in a long, cold breath, and blew it out. “Fare you well, my friends,” he muttered. “Fare you well.” Then he threw his pack over his shoulder, turned, and began to flounder through the deep snow. Downwards, southwards, out of the mountains.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was raining, still. A soft rain that coated everything in cold dew, collected on the branches, on the leaves, on the needles, and dripped off in great fat drops that soaked through Logen’s wet clothes and onto his wet skin.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He squatted, still and silent, in the damp brush, water running down his face, the bright blade of his knife glistening with wet. He felt the great motion of the forest and heard all its thousand sounds. The countless crawling of the insects, the blind scuttling of the moles, the timid rustling of the deer, the slow pulsing of the sap in the old tree trunks. Each thing alive in the forest was in search of its own kind of food, and he was the same. He let his mind settle on an animal close to him, moving cautiously through the woods to his right. Delicious. The forest grew silent but for the endless dripping of water from the branches. The world shrank down to Logen and his next meal.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">When he reckoned it was close enough, he sprang forward and bore it down onto the wet ground. A young deer. It kicked and struggled but he was strong and quick, and he stabbed his knife into its neck and chopped the throat out. Hot blood surged from the wound, spilled out across Logen’s hands, onto the wet earth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He picked up the carcass and slung it over his shoulders. That would be good in a stew, maybe with some mushrooms. Very good. Then, once he’d eaten, he would ask the spirits for guidance. Their guidance was pretty useless, but the company would be welcome.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">When he reached his camp it was close to sunset. It was a dwelling fit for a hero of Logen’s stature—two big sticks holding a load of damp branches over a hollow in the dirt. Still, it was halfway dry in there, and the rain had stopped. He would have a fire tonight. It was a long time since he’d had a treat like that. A fire, and all his own.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Later, well fed and rested, Logen pressed a lump of chagga into his pipe. He’d found it growing a few days before at the base of a tree, big moist yellow discs of it. He’d broken off a good chunk for himself, but it hadn’t dried out enough to smoke until today. Now he took a burning twig from the fire and stuck it in the bowl, puffing away hard until the fungus caught and began to burn, giving off its familiar earthy-sweet smell.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen coughed, blew out brown smoke and stared into the shifting flames. His mind went back to other times and other campfires. The Dogman was there, grinning, the light gleaming on his pointy teeth. Tul Duru was sitting opposite, big as a mountain, laughing like thunder. Forley the Weakest too, with those nervous eyes darting around, always a little scared. Rudd Threetrees was there, and Harding Grim, saying nothing. He never did say anything. That was why they called him Grim.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They were all there. Only they weren’t. They were all dead, gone back to the mud. Logen tapped the pipe out into the fire and shoved it away. He had no taste for it now. His father had been right. You should never smoke alone.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He unscrewed the cap of the battered flask, took a mouthful, and blew it out in a spray of tiny drops. A gout of flame went up into the cold air. Logen wiped his lips, savouring the hot, bitter taste. Then he sat back against the knotted trunk of a pine, and waited.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was a while before they came. Three of them. They came silently from the dancing shadows among the trees and made slowly for the fire, taking shape as they moved into the light.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ninefingers,” said the first.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ninefingers,” the second.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ninefingers,” the third, voices like the thousand sounds of the forest.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re right welcome to my fire,” said Logen. The spirits squatted and stared at him without expression. “Only three tonight?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The one on the right spoke first. “Every year fewer of us wake from the winter. We are all that remain. A few more winters will pass, and we will sleep also. There will be none of us left to answer your call.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen nodded sadly. “Any news from the world?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We heard a man fell off a cliff but washed up alive, then crossed the High Places at the start of spring, wrapped in a rotten blanket, but we put no faith in such rumours.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Very wise.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bethod has been making war,” said the spirit in the centre.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen frowned. “Bethod is always making war. That’s what he does.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes. He has won so many fights now, with your help, he has given himself a golden hat.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shit on that bastard,” said Logen, spitting into the fire. “What else?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“North of the mountains, the Shanka run around and burn things.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They love the fire,” said the spirit in the centre.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They do,” said the one on the left, “even more than your kind, Ninefingers. They love and fear it.” The spirit leaned forwards. “We heard there is a man seeking for you in the moors to the south.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A powerful man,” said the one in the centre.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A Magus of the Old Time,” the one on the left.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen frowned. He’d heard of these Magi. He met a sorcerer once, but he’d been easy to kill. No unnatural powers in particular, not that Logen had noticed. But a Magus was something else.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We heard that the Magi are wise and strong,” said the spirit in the centre, “and that such a one could take a man far and show him many things. But they are crafty too, and have their own purposes.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What does he want?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ask him.” Spirits cared little for the business of men, they were always weak on the details. Still, this was better than the usual talk about trees.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What will you do, Ninefingers?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen considered a moment. “I will go south and find this Magus, and ask him what he wants from me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The spirits nodded. They didn’t show whether they thought it was a good idea or bad. They didn’t care.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Farewell then, Ninefingers,” said the spirit on the right, “perhaps for the last time.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’ll try to struggle on without you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen’s wit was wasted on them. They rose and moved away from the fire, fading gradually into the darkness. Soon they were gone, but Logen had to admit they had been more use than he dared to hope. They had given him a purpose.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He would head south in the morning, head south and find this Magus. Who knew? He might be a good talker. Had to be better than being shot full of arrows for nothing, at least. Logen looked into the flames, nodding slowly to himself.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He remembered other times and other campfires, when he had not been alone.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_5"></div></div></body>

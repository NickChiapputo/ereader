<div id="filepos655045" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Means of Escape</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Open the door, in the name of His Majesty!” thundered Lieutenant Jalenhorm for the third time, hammering at the wood with his meaty fist. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The great oaf. Why do big men tend to have such little brains? Perhaps they get by on brawn too often, and their minds dry up like plums in the sun.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Mercers’ Guildhall was an impressive building in a busy square not far from the Agriont. A substantial crowd of onlookers had already gathered around Glokta and his armed escort: curious, fearful, fascinated, growing all the time. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">They can smell blood, it seems.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta’s leg was throbbing from the effort of hurrying down here, but he doubted that the Mercers would be taken entirely by surprise. He glanced round impatiently at the armoured guardsmen, at the masked Practicals, at the hard eyes of Frost, at the young officer beating on the door.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Open the—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Enough of this foolishness.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “I think they heard you, Lieutenant,” said Glokta crisply, “but are choosing not to answer. Would you be so kind as to break the door down?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What?” Jalenhorm gawped at him, and then at the heavy double doors, firmly secured. “How will I—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Practical Frost hurtled past. There was a deafening crack and a tearing of wood as he crashed into one of the doors with his burly shoulder, tearing it off its hinges and sending it crashing onto the floor of the room beyond.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Like so,” muttered Glokta as he stepped through the archway, the splinters still settling. Jalenhorm followed him, looking dazed, a dozen armoured soldiers clattering behind.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">An outraged clerk blocked the-corridor beyond. “You can’t just—oof!” he cried, as Frost flung him out of the way and his face crunched into the wall.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Arrest that man!” shouted Glokta, waving his cane at the dumbstruck clerk. One of the soldiers grabbed him roughly with gauntleted fists and shoved him tumbling out into the daylight. Practicals began to pour through the broken doors, heavy sticks in their hands, eyes fierce above their masks. “Arrest everyone!” shouted Glokta over his shoulder, limping down the corridor as fast as he could, following Frost’s broad back into the bowels of the building.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Through an open door Glokta saw a merchant in colourful robes, face covered with a sheen of sweat as he desperately heaped documents onto a blazing fire. “Seize him!” screamed Glokta. A pair of Practicals leaped past into the room and began clubbing the man with their sticks. He fell with a cry, upsetting a table and kicking over a pile of ledgers. Loose papers and bits of burning ash fluttered through the air as the sticks rose and fell.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta hurried on, crashes and cries spreading out into the building around him. The place was full of the smell of smoke, and sweat, and fear. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The doors are all guarded, but Kault might have a secret means of escape. He’s a slippery one. We must hope we are not too late. Curse this leg of mine! Not too late…</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta gasped and winced in pain, tottering as someone clutched at his coat. “Help me!” shrieked the man, “I am innocent!” Blood on a plump face. Fingers clutched at Glokta’s clothes, threatening to drag him to the floor.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Get him off me!” shouted Glokta, beating at him weakly with his cane, clawing at the wall in his efforts to stay upright. One of the Practicals leaped forward and clubbed the man across the back.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I confess!” the merchant whimpered as the stick rose again, then it cracked down on his head. The Practical caught hold of his slumping body under the arms and dragged him back towards the door. Glokta hurried on, Lieutenant Jalenhorm wide-eyed at his shoulder. They reached a broad staircase, and Glokta eyed it with hatred. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">My old enemies, always here ahead of me.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He laboured up as best he could, waving Practical Frost forward with his free hand. A baffled merchant was dragged past them and away, squawking something about his rights, heels kicking against the stairs.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta slipped and nearly fell on his face, but someone caught him by the elbow and kept him upright. It was Jalenhorm, a look of confusion still splattered across his heavy, honest face. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">So big men have their uses after all.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The young officer helped him up the rest of the steps. Glokta did not have the energy to refuse him. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Why bother? A man should know his limitations. There’s nothing noble in falling on your face. I should know that.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a large ante-chamber at the top of the stairs, richly decorated with a thick carpet and colourful hangings on the walls. Two guards stood before a large door with their swords drawn, dressed in the livery of the Guild of Mercers. Frost was facing them, hands rolled into white fists. Jalenhorm pulled out his own sword as he reached the landing, stepping forward to stand next to the albino. Glokta had to smile. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The tongueless torturer and the flower of chivalry. An unlikely alliance.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I have a warrant for Kault, signed by the King himself.” Glokta held out the paper so the guards could see it. “The Mercers are finished. You have nothing to gain by getting in our way. Put up your swords! You have my word, you will not be harmed!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The two guards glanced at each other uncertainly. “Put them up!” shouted Jalenhorm, edging a little closer.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Alright!” One of the men bent down and slid his sword along the boards. Frost caught it under one foot.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And you!” shouted Glokta to the other one. “Now!” The guard obeyed, throwing his sword to the floor and putting up his hands. A moment later Frost’s fist crunched into the point of his jaw, knocking him cold and sending him crashing into the wall.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But—” shouted the first guard. Frost grabbed him by the shirt and flung him down the stairs. He turned over and over, banging on the steps, flopping to the bottom, lying still. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I know what that feels like.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jalenhorm was standing motionless and blinking, his sword still raised. “I thought you said—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Never mind about that. Frost, look for another way in.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Thhh.” The albino padded away down the corridor. Glokta gave him a moment, then he edged forward and tried the door. The handle turned, much to his surprise, and the door swung open.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The room was opulence itself, near as big as a barn. The carving on the high ceiling was caked in gold leaf, the spines of the books on the shelves were studded with precious stones, the monstrous furniture was polished to a mirror shine. All was over-sized, over-embellished, over-expensive. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But who needs taste when you have money?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> There were several big windows of the new design, large panes with little lead between them, offering a splendid view of the city, the bay, the ships within it. Magister Kault sat smiling at his vast gilt desk before the middle window in his fabulous robes of office, partly overshadowed by an enormous cabinet, the arms of the honourable Guild of Mercers etched into its doors.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Then he has not got away. I have him. I…</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Tied around the thick leg of the cabinet was a rope. Glokta followed it with his eyes as it snaked across the floor. The other end was tied around the Magister’s neck. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Ah. So he does have a means of escape, after all.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Inquisitor Glokta!” Kault gave a squeaky, nervous laugh. “What a pleasure to finally meet you! I’ve been hearing all about your investigations!” His fingers twitched at the knot on the rope, making sure it was tied securely.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Is your collar too tight, Magister? Perhaps you should remove it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Another squeak of merriment. “Oh, I don’t think so! I don’t intend to be answering any of your questions, thank you!” Out of the corner of his eye, Glokta saw a side door edging open. A big white hand appeared, fingers curling slowly round the door frame. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Frost. There is still hope of catching him, then. I must keep him talking.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There are no questions left to answer. We know it all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Do you indeed?” giggled the Magister. The albino edged silently into the room, keeping to the shadows near the wall, hidden from Kault by the bulk of the cabinet.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We know about Kalyne. About your little arrangement.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Imbecile! We had no arrangement! He was far too honourable to be bought! He would never take a mark from me!” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Then how…</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Kault smiled a sick little smile. “Sult’s secretary,” he said, giggling again. “Right under his nose, and yours too, cripple!” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Fool, fool—the secretary carried the messages, he saw the confession, he knew everything! I never trusted that smarmy shit. Kalyne was loyal, then.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta shrugged. “We all make mistakes.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Magister gave a withering sneer. “Mistakes? That’s all you’ve made, dolt! The world is nothing like you think it is! You don’t even know what side you’re on! You don’t even know what the sides are!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I am on the side of the King, and you are not. That is all I need to know.” Frost had made it to the cabinet and was pressed against it, pink eyes staring intently, trying to see round the corner without being seen. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Just a little longer, just a little further…</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You know nothing, cripple! Some small business with tax, some petty bribery, that’s all we were guilty of!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And the trifling matter of nine murders.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We had no choice!” screamed Kault. “We never had any choices! We had to pay the bankers! They loaned us the money, and we had to pay! We’ve been paying them for years! Valint and Balk, the bloodsuckers! We gave them everything, but they always wanted more!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Valint and Balk? Bankers?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta threw an eye over the ridiculous opulence. “You seem to be keeping your head above water.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Seem! Seem! All dust! All lies! The bankers own it all! They own us all! We owe them thousands! Millions!” Kault giggled to himself. “But I don’t suppose they’ll ever get it now, will they?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No. I don’t suppose they will.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Kault leaned across the desk, the rope hanging down and brushing the leather top. “You want criminals, Glokta? You want traitors? Enemies of King and state? Look in the Closed Council. Look in the House of Questions. Look in the University. Look in the banks, Glokta!” He saw Frost, edging round the cabinet no more than four strides away. His eyes went wide and he started up from his chair.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Get him!” screamed Glokta. Frost sprang forward, lunged across the desk, caught hold of the flicking hem of Kault’s robe of office as the Magister span round and hurled himself at the window. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">We have him!</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a sickening rip as the robe tore in Frost’s white fist. Kault seemed frozen in space for a moment as all that expensive glass shattered around him, shards and splinters glittering through the air, then he was gone. The rope snapped taut.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Thhhhh!” hissed Frost, glaring at the broken window.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He jumped!” gasped Jalenhorm, his mouth hanging open.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Clearly.” Glokta limped over to the desk and took the ripped strip of cloth from Frost’s hands. Close up it scarcely seemed magnificent at all: brightly coloured but badly woven.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who would have thought?” muttered Glokta to himself. “Poor quality.” He limped to the window and peered through the shattered hole. The head of the honourable Guild of Mercers was swinging slowly back and forth, twenty feet below, his torn, gold-embroidered gown flapping around him in the breeze. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Cheap clothes and expensive windows. If the cloth had been stronger we would have got him. If the window had more lead, we would have got him. Lives hinge on such chances.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Beneath him in the street a horrified crowd was already gathering: pointing, babbling, staring up at the hanging body. A woman screamed. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Fear, or excitement? They sound the same.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Lieutenant, would you be so good as to go down and disperse that crowd? Then we can cut our friend loose and take him back with us.” Jalenhorm looked at him blankly. “Dead or alive, the King’s warrant must be served.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, of course.” The burly officer wiped sweat from his forehead and made, somewhat unsteadily, for the door.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta turned back to the window and peered down at the slowly swinging corpse. Magister Kault’s last words echoed in his mind.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Look in the Closed Council. Look in the House of Questions. Look in the University. Look in the banks, Glokta!</span></span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_24"></div></div></body>

<div id="filepos1050337" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> The Seed</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“How are you, Sand?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Colonel Glokta opened his eyes. It was dark in the room. Damn it, he was late!</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Damn it!” he shouted, shoving back the covers and leaping out of bed. “I’m late!” He snatched up his uniform trousers, shoving his legs in, fumbling with his belt.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Don’t worry about that, Sand!” His mother’s voice was half soothing, half impatient. “Where is the Seed?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta frowned over as he pushed his shirt in. “I’ve no time for this nonsense, mother! Why do you always think you know what’s best for me?” He cast around him for his sword, but couldn’t see it. “We’re at war you know!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We are indeed.” The Colonel looked up, surprised. It was the voice of Arch Lector Sult. “Two wars. One fought with fire and steel, and another one beneath—an old war, long years in the making.” Glokta frowned. How ever could he have mistaken that old windbag for his mother? And what was he doing in Glokta’s chambers in any case? Sitting in the chair at the foot of his bed, prattling about old wars?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What the hell are you doing in my chambers?” growled Colonel Glokta, “and what have you done with my sword?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Where is the Seed?” A woman’s voice now, but not his mother’s. Someone else. He did not recognise it. He squinted against the darkness, straining to see who was in the chair. He could make out a vague outline, but the shadows were too deep to tell more.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who are you?” asked Glokta sternly.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who was I? Or what am I?” The figure in the chair shifted as it rose slowly, smoothly, from its seat. “I was a patient woman, but I am woman no more, and the grinding years have worn my patience thin.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What do you want?” Glokta’s voice quivered, reedy and weak as he backed away.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The figure moved, stepping through the shaft of moonlight from the window. A woman’s form, slender and graceful, but shadows stuck to the face. A sudden fear clawed at him and he stumbled back against the wall, raising his arm to fend the woman off.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I want the Seed.” A pale hand snaked out and closed around his outstretched arm. A gentle touch, but cold. Cold as stone. Glokta trembled, gasped, squeezed shut his eyes. “I need it. You cannot know the need I have. Where is it?” Fingers plucked at his clothes, quick and deft, seeking, searching, darting in his pockets, in his shirt, brushing his skin. Cold. Cold as glass.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Seed?” squeaked Glokta, half paralysed with terror.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You know what I speak of, broken man. Where is it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Maker fell…” he whispered. The words welled up, he knew not from where.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I know it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“…burning, burning…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I saw it.” The face was close enough for him to feel the breath upon his skin. Cold. Cold as frost.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“…he broke upon the bridge below…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I remember it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“…they searched for the Seed…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes…” whispered the voice, urgent in his ear, “where is it?” Something brushed against his face, his cheek, his eyelid, soft and slimy. A tongue. Cold. Cold as ice. His flesh crawled.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I don’t know! They could not find it!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Could not?” Fingers closed tight around his throat, squeezing, crushing, choking the air from him. Cold. Cold as iron, and just as hard. “You think you know pain, broken man? You know nothing!” The icy breath rasped in his ear, the icy fingers squeezed, squeezed. “But I can show you! I can show you!”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta screamed, thrashed, struggled. He fought his way up, stood for a dizzy instant, then his leg buckled and he plunged into space. The dark room tumbled around him and he crashed to the boards with a sickening crunch, his arm folded beneath him, his forehead cracking against the floor.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He struggled up, clawing at the leg of his bed, pushing himself against the wall, snorting for breath, staring wild-eyed towards the chair, yet barely able to look for fear. A bar of moonlight spilled through the window, cut across the rumpled bed-clothes and onto the polished wood of the seat. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Empty.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta cast around the rest of the room, eyes adjusting to the darkness, peering into every shadowy corner. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Nothing. Empty. A dream.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">And now, as the crazy hammering of his heart relaxed, as his ragged breathing slowed, the pain came on. His head thumped, his leg screamed, his arm was throbbing dully. He could taste blood, his eyes stung and wept, his guts heaved, sick and spinning. He whimpered, made an agonising hop towards the bed, then collapsed on the moonlit mattress, exhausted, wet with cold sweat.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was an urgent knocking at the door. “Sir? Are you alright?” Barnam’s voice. The knocking came again. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">No good. It is locked. Always locked, but I don’t think I’ll be moving. Frost will have to break it down.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> But the door swung open, and Glokta shielded his eyes from the sudden ruddy glow of the old servant’s lamp.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Are you alright?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I fell,” mumbled Glokta. “My arm…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old servant perched on the bed, taking Glokta’s hand gently and pushing up the sleeve of his night-shirt. Glokta winced, Barnam clicked his tongue. His forearm had a big pink mark across it, already beginning to swell and redden.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I don’t think it’s broken,” said the servant, “but I should fetch the surgeon, just in case.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, yes.” He waved Barnam away with his good hand. “Fetch him.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta watched the old servant hurry, stooped, out of the door, heard him creaking along the narrow corridor outside, down the narrow stairs. He heard the front door banging shut. Silence descended.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He looked over at the scroll he had taken from the Adeptus Historical, still rolled up tight on the dresser, waiting to be delivered to Arch Lector Sult. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The Maker fell burning. He broke upon the bridge below. Strange, how parts of the waking world stray into one’s dreams. That damned Northman and his intruder. A woman, and cold. That’ll be what set me off.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta rubbed his arm gently, pressing the sore flesh with his fingertips. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Nothing. Just a dream.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> And yet something was niggling at him. He looked over at the back of the door. The key was still in the lock, shining orange in the light from the lamp. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Not locked, and yet I must have locked it. Must have. I always do.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta looked back to the empty chair. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">What did that idiot apprentice say? Magic comes from the Other Side. The world below. Hell.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Somehow, at that moment, after that dream, it did not seem so difficult to believe. The fear was building in him again, now he was alone. He stretched out his good hand towards the chair. It took an age to get there, trembling, shaking. His fingers touched the wood. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Cool, but not cold. Not cold. There is nothing there.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He slowly withdrew his hand, cradled his pulsing arm. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Nothing. Empty.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A dream.</span></span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What the hell happened to you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta sucked sourly at his gums. “Fell out of bed.” He scratched absently at his wrist through the dressing. Until a moment ago it had been throbbing like hell, but the sight in front of him had pushed the pain into the back of his mind. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I could be worse off. A lot worse.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Not a pretty sight. Not at all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re damn right it’s not.” Severard looked as disgusted as was possible with half his face covered. “I nearly puked when I first saw it. Me!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta peered down, frowning, at the tangled mess of butchery, supporting himself against a tree-trunk with one hand and pushing some of the ferns aside with the tip of his cane to get a better look. “Are we even sure it’s a man?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Might be a woman. Human anyway. That’s a foot.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, so it is. How was it found?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He found it.” Severard nodded over towards a gardener: sat on the ground, pale-faced and staring, and with a small pool of drying vomit on the grass beside him. “In amongst the trees here, hidden in the bushes. Looks as if whatever killed it tried to hide it, but not long ago. It’s fresh.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">It is indeed—barely any smell, and only a couple of flies have arrived. Very fresh, perhaps last night even.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “It might not have been found for days, except someone asked for one of these trees to be pruned. Blocking out the light or something. You ever see anything like this?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta shrugged. “In Angland, once, before you came. One of the convicts tried to escape. He made it a few miles, then succumbed to the cold. A bear made free with the corpse. That was quite a mess, though not near as bad as this one.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I can’t see anyone freezing to death last night. It was hot as hell.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Mmm,” said Glokta. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">If hell is hot. I’ve always thought it might be cold. Cold as ice.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “There are few bears within the Agriont in any case. Do we have any idea as to the identity of this…” he waved his cane towards the carcass “…person?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“None.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Is anyone unaccounted for? Reported missing?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not that I’ve heard.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So we have not the slightest idea even who our victim is? Why the hell are we taking an interest? Don’t we have a fake Magus to be watching?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s just it. Their new quarters are right over there.” Severard’s gloved finger pointed out a building not twenty strides away. “I was watching them when this came to light.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta raised an eyebrow. “I see. And you suspect some connection, do you?” The Practical shrugged. “Mysterious intruders in the dead of night, gruesome murders on their very doorstep? Our visitors draw trouble like shit draws flies.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh,” said Severard, swatting a fly away with his gloved hand. “I looked into that other thing as well. Your bankers. Valint and Balk.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta looked up. “Really? And?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And not a lot. An old house. Very old and very well respected. Their notes are good as gold among the merchants. They’ve got offices all across Midderland, Angland, Starikland, in Westport, in Dagoska. Even outside the Union. Powerful people, by all accounts. All kind of folk owe them money, I reckon. Strange thing though, no one seems ever to have met a Valint or a Balk. Who can tell with banks though, eh? They love secrets. You want me to dig any more?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">It could be dangerous. Very dangerous. Dig too far and we might be digging our own graves.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “No. We’d better leave off. For now. Keep your ears open though.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“My ears are always open, chief. So who do you like for the Contest?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta glanced across at the Practical. “How can you think about that with this in front of you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Practical shrugged. “It won’t do ’em any harm, will it?” Glokta looked back at the mangled body. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I suppose it wont, at that.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “So come on, you should know, Luthar or Gorst?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gorst.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I hope he carves the little bastard in two.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Really? People say he’s a clumsy ox. Lucky is all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, I say he’s a genius,” said Glokta. “In a couple of years they’ll all be fencing like him, if you can call it fencing. You mark my words.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gorst, eh? Maybe I’ll have a little bet.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You do that. But in the meantime you’d better scrape this mess up and take it to the University. Get Frost to give you a hand, he’s got a strong stomach.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The University?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well we can’t just leave it here. Some fashionable lady taking a turn in the park could get an awful shock.” Severard giggled. “And I might just know of someone who can shed some light on this little mystery.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“This is quite an interesting discovery you’ve made, Inquisitor.” The Adeptus Physical paused in his work and peered over at Glokta, one eye enormously magnified through his glittering eyeglass. “Quite a fascinating discovery,” he muttered, as he returned to the corpse with his instruments: lifting, prodding, twisting, squinting down at the glistening flesh.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta peered round the laboratory, his lip curling with distaste. Jars of many different sizes lined two of the four walls, filled with floating, pickled lumps of meat. Some of those floating things Glokta recognised as parts of the human body, some he did not. Even he felt slightly uncomfortable in amongst the macabre display. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I wonder how Kandelau came by them all? Do his visitors end up dismembered, floating in a dozen different jars? Perhaps I would make an interesting specimen?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Fascinating.” The Adeptus loosened the strap of his eye-glass and perched it on top of his head, rubbing at the pink ring it had left behind around his eye. “What can you tell me about it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta frowned. “I came here to find out what </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">you</span></span><span class="calibre3"> can tell </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">me</span></span><span class="calibre3"> about it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course, of course.” Kandelau pursed his lips. “Well, er, as to the gender of our unfortunate friend, er…” he trailed off.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Heh heh, well, er, the organs that would allow one to make an easy determination are…” and he gestured at the meat on the table, harshly lit under the blazing lamps “…absent.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And that is the sum of your investigation?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, there are other things: a man’s third finger is typically longer than his first, not necessarily so with a woman but, heh, our remnant does not have all the digits necessary to make such a judgement. As to gender, therefore, without the fingers, we are quite stumped!” He giggled nervously at his own joke. Glokta did not.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Young or old?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, er, again that is quite difficult to determine, I am afraid. The, er,” and the Adeptus tapped at the corpse with his tongs, “teeth here are in good condition and, heh, such skin as remains would appear to be consistent with a younger person but, er, this is really just, heh heh—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So what can you tell me about the victim?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Er, well… nothing.” And he smiled apologetically. “But I have made some interesting discoveries as to the cause of death!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Really?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh yes, look at this!” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I would rather not.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta limped cautiously over to the bench, peering down at the spot the old man was indicating.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You see here? The shape of this wound?” The Adeptus prodded at a flap of gristle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No I do not see,” said Glokta. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">It appears all to be one enormous wound to me.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man leaned towards him, his eyes wide. “Human,” he said.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We know that it is human! This is a foot!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No! No! These teeth marks, here… they are human bites!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta frowned. “Human… bites?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Absolutely!” Kandelau’s beaming smile was quite at odds with the surroundings. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And with the subject matter, I rather think.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “This individual was bitten to death by another person, and, heh heh, in all likelihood,” and he gestured triumphantly at the mess on his table, “considering the incomplete nature of the remains… partially eaten!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta stared at the old man for a moment. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Eaten? Eaten? Why must every question answered raise ten more?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “This is what you would have me tell the Arch Lector?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Adeptus laughed nervously. “Well, heh heh, these are the facts, as I see them…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A person, unidentified, perhaps a man, perhaps a woman, either young or old, was attacked in the park by an unknown assailant, bitten to death within two hundred strides of the King’s palace and partially… eaten?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Er…” Kandelau gave a worried glance sideways towards the entrance. Glokta turned to look, and frowned. There was a new arrival there, one that he had not heard enter. A woman, standing in the shadows at the edge of the bright lamp-light with her arms folded. A tall woman with short, spiky red hair and a black mask on her face, staring at Glokta and the Adeptus through narrowed eyes. A Practical. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But not one I recognise, and women are quite a rarity in the Inquisition. I would have thought…</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good afternoon, good afternoon!” A man stepped briskly through the door: gaunt, balding, with a long black coat and a prim little smile on his face. An unpleasantly familiar man. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Goyle, damn him. Our new Superior of Adua, arrived at last. Great news.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Inquisitor Glokta,” he purred, “what an absolute pleasure it is to see you again!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Likewise, Superior Goyle.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">You bastard.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Two other figures followed close behind the grinning Superior, making the glaring little room seem quite crowded. One was a dark-skinned, stocky Kantic with a big golden ring through his ear, the other was a monster of a Northman with a face like a stone slab. He almost had to stoop to cram himself through the doorway. Both were masked and dressed from head to toe in Practicals black.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“This is Practical Vitari,” chuckled Goyle, indicating the red-haired woman, who had flowed over to the jars and was peering into them, one at a time, tapping on the glass and making the specimens wobble. “And these are Practicals Halim,” the Southerner sidled past Goyle and into the room, busy eyes darting here and there, “and Byre.” The monstrous Northman gazed down at Glokta from up near the ceiling. “In his own country they call him the Stone-Splitter, would you believe, but I don’t think that would work here, do you Glokta? Practical Stone-Splitter, can you imagine?” He laughed softly to himself and shook his head.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And this is the Inquisition? I had no idea the circus was in town. I wonder if they stand on each other’s shoulders? Or jump through flaming hoops?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A remarkably diverse selection,” said Glokta.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh yes,” laughed Goyle, “I have picked them up wherever my travels have taken me, eh my friends?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The woman shrugged as she prowled around the jars. The dark-skinned Practical inclined his head. The towering Northman simply stood there.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Wherever my travels have taken me!” chuckled Goyle, just as though everyone else had laughed with him. “And I have more besides! It’s been quite a time, I do declare!” He wiped a tear of mirth from his eye as he moved towards the table in the centre of the room. It seemed that everything was a source of amusement to him, even the thing on the bench. “But what’s all this? A body, unless I’m quite mistaken!” Goyle looked up sharply, his eyes sparkling. “A body? A death within the city? As Superior of Adua, surely that falls within my province?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta bowed. “Naturally. I was not aware that you had arrived, Superior Goyle. Also, I felt that the unusual circumstances of this—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Unusual? I see nothing unusual.” Glokta paused. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">What game is this chuckling fool playing?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Surely you would agree that the violence here is… exceptional.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Goyle gave a flamboyant shrug. “Dogs.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Dogs?” asked Glokta, unable to let that one pass. “Domestic pets run mad, do you think, or wild ones which climbed over the walls?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Superior only smiled. “Whichever you like, Inquisitor. Whichever you like.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m afraid it could not possibly be dogs,” the Adeptus Physical began pompously to explain. “I was only just making clear to Inquisitor Glokta… these marks here, and on the skin here, do you see? These are human bites, undoubtedly…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The woman sauntered away from the jars, closer and closer to Kandelau, leaning in towards him until her mask was only inches away from his beak of a nose. He slowly trailed off. “Dogs,” she whispered, then barked in his face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Adeptus jumped away. “Well, I suppose I could have been mistaken… of course…” He backed into the enormous Northman’s chest, who had moved with surprising speed to position himself directly behind. Kandelau turned slowly around, staring up with wide eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Dogs,” intoned the giant.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Dogs, dogs, dogs,” hummed the southerner in a thick accent.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course,” squeaked Kandelau, “dogs, of course, how foolish I’ve been!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Dogs!” shouted Goyle in delight, throwing his hands in the air. “The mystery is solved!” To Glokta’s amazement, two of the three Practicals began politely to applaud. The woman stayed silent. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I never believed that I would miss Superior Kalyne, but suddenly I am overcome with nostalgia.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Goyle turned slowly round, bowing low. “My first day here, and already I warm to the work! You can bury this,” he said, gesturing to the corpse and smiling broadly at the cringing Adeptus. “Best buried, eh?” He looked over at the Northman. “Back to the mud, as you say in your country!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The massive Practical showed not the slightest sign that anyone had spoken. The Kantic was standing there, turning the ring through his ear round and round. The woman was peering down at the carcass on the table, sniffing at it through her mask. The Adeptus Physical was backed up against his jars, sweating profusely.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Enough of this pantomime. I have work to do.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Well,” said Glokta stiffly, limping for the door, “the mystery is solved. You don’t need me any more.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Superior Goyle turned to look at him, his good humour suddenly vanished. “No!” he hissed, furious little eyes nearly popping out of his head. “We don’t… need you… any more!”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_38"></div></div></body>

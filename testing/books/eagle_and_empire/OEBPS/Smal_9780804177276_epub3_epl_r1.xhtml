<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">I</span>t was the day of the Midsummer Feast in Cahokia, almost a year later. For the last two weeks Youtin had been at the Circle of the Cedars every dawn and dusk, making his observations of the sun. The old shaman now walked slowly with sticks, and it was widely accepted that his young acolyte Kiche did much of the real work, but it was Youtin who took responsibility and who made the pronouncement that morning from the top of the Great Mound. Tahtay listened carefully, showing the old man deep respect and thus helping to heal the last fracture in Cahokian society. As soon as Youtin had finished, Tahtay repeated the announcement with greater volume and followed it by asking the women to commence the preparation of food in the huge jars. Today, Cahokia would feast.</p>
<p class="para-p">The previous weeks had seen long discussions in the smoke lodge of the elders and even more extensive debate in a full council of clan chiefs. As a result, on the evening of the Midsummer Feast, Tahtay came to the crest of the Great Mound in the full regalia of a war chief of Cahokia: the feathered cloak, the kilt, and the ear spools of the Long-Nosed God. He lacked only the chert mace that went with the title of Great Sun Man, which would not be his for a little longer.</p>
<p class="para-p">The ceremonial clothing of a Cahokian paramount chief no longer looked outlandish to Marcellinus. On Tahtay this evening it looked just right, and well earned.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page494" title="494"/>
<p class="para-p">The Great Plaza was packed, and so were the streets beyond in all directions, out to the east and west and as far back as the Mound of the Women. Cahokia had never been so crowded. Tahtay made his speech not only to his own people, the residents of Cahokia and Ocatan, but also to extensive contingents from the Haudenosaunee, Blackfoot, Cherokee, Ojibwa, Huron, Powhatani, and People of the Hand. After the Midsummer Feast the sachems and headmen of the other tribes would stay another moon for a powwow, the first massed gathering of the Hesperian League in peacetime.</p>
<p class="para-p">As Tahtay made clear during his long oration, Cahokia did not rule the other members of the League. He carefully claimed no precedence over the chiefs of the other tribes. When decisions of great import were needed, all would speak, all would listen, all would decide, and all would have to agree. The Hesperian League would largely follow the precedents set by the Haudenosaunee League.</p>
<p class="para-p">However, Cahokia’s preeminence was clear to everyone there. It was the biggest city and close to being centrally located in the great continent of Hesperia, the Mizipi and its tributaries made it the hub of the river network that provided the major Hesperian thoroughfares, and Cahokia had the best wings and pilots. If envoys came from Roma seeking trade, it would be Cahokia’s leaders and Marcellinus whom they would negotiate with first. And so, if Cahokia was the first among equals, it was first by a considerable margin.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala stood by Tahtay’s side on the crest of the Great Mound. Their eminence and association were also clear to all. At such moments the city bowed to them. Behind Tahtay stood his wife, Taianita, and his leading advisers, Enopay and Dustu, and behind them the array of other clan chiefs and elders, with Chenoa, Pahin, Matoshka, Howahkan, Wahchintonka, and Hanska among them. There, too, stood the Tadodaho of the Haudenosaunee, a craggy elder of the Blackfoot, and the young, bronzed leader of the People of the Hand.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus listened to the speech from the left edge of the Great Plaza. He stood next to Takoda, Nahimana, and their family, with his arms wrapped around Kimimela. The parts of the speech he could not hear, he read from the hand-talkers on the first plateau and out to the side on the Mound of the Sun, or just ignored. He still did not understand all the allusions to Red Horn and the other figures of Cahokian mythology.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page495" title="495"/>
<p class="para-p">He ought to do something about that. After all, his arms and back were now etched with Cahokian war tattoos. He owed his hosts the courtesy of trying to understand them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Takoda’s hair was streaked with early gray. His oldest child, a mere babe in arms when Marcellinus had first arrived, was a stout young man of twelve winters. His second child, nine winters old, Marcellinus still only knew as Ciqala, even though that just meant “baby” in Cahokian, and Ciqala had a baby brother of his own. And at long last Kangee appeared to be mellowing toward Marcellinus. Just a little. On good days.</p>
<p class="para-p">Nahimana was even older and more acerbic than ever, but she had recovered completely from her stroke, and if her hip was no better than it had been when Marcellinus first arrived, at least it was no worse. It seemed entirely likely that she would outlive him.</p>
<p class="para-p">So many Cahokians had not. Friends who had died in battles or in their catastrophic aftermath, who would remain in his thoughts and his heart forever. The beautiful, skillful, and cheeky Hurit. His wise and clever Raven clan chief, Anapetu. Too many braves, among them the courageous and funny Mahkah, Yahto, and Mikasi. His wise old friend Kanuna. And hundreds of other men and women he had known by sight or reputation who had fallen in the battles of Cahokia, Yupkoyvi, Shappa Ta’atan, and the Grass. Even longer ago, his comrades in arms from across the Atlanticus: Pollius Scapax, Thorkell Sigurdsson, even Corbulo. And Great Sun Man, whose steady presence Marcellinus missed to this day.</p>
<p class="para-p">So much war. So much blood.</p>
<p class="para-p">The shadows lengthened, and the rays of the sun shone even more golden on the thatched roofs of Cahokia. The summer humidity had respectfully taken two steps back; by the standards of the bottomlands it was a dry evening, and tonight’s feasting would be comfortable. Around the plaza’s edges a host of women stood next to tall jars of food. Feeding this immense crowd would be impossible, but just as Enopay had advised Great Sun Man many years before, many people had contributed food of their own.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page496" title="496"/>
<p class="para-p">Over the smells of people, smoke, and cooking meat the most prevalent was that of the terrible mash beer the Cahokians favored, laced with fermented tree sap. Marcellinus, of course, had made his own arrangements. Brewing the kind of beer he liked could be done only in small batches, and if he had subverted the attention of the artisans in Cahokia’s steelworks to ensure there would be enough tonight to slake their thirsts and those of his other close friends, that would be their secret.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay reached the end of his long speech. At just that moment, the sun set. The crowd roared so loudly that Marcellinus thought his ears might burst. Kimimela hugged him all the more.</p>
<p class="para-p">Up on the crest of the Great Mound, Tahtay turned to his advisers and elders. The applause from the masses died down, replaced with a babble of conversation and a determined movement toward the vats of food.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Tahtay did not mention the west,” Kimimela said, her eyes serious.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus grunted. “You expected him to?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Predictably, Isleifur had faded into the trees rather than climb aboard a Roman quinquereme. He and the scouts of the Hand had been busy that winter and spring and had brought back their reports not long since. The Mongol army under Subodei Badahur had completed its long trek back to the western coast and set sail back to Asia with the body of their deceased Khan. But they had left a sizable contingent of Mongol warriors to hold the lands west of the Great Mountain range. The traders and refugees out of the west confirmed that Yesulun Khatun, Chagatai’s wife, had indeed remained behind to administer the region.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hesperians from the tribes up and down the western coast were still in forced servitude to the invaders. Even now they were sluicing gold out of the rivers and breaking it out of the mountains to give to their Mongol overlords. The continent of Nova Hesperia was not yet free from the Mongol curse, and sometime in the coming weeks the Hesperian League would have to decide what to do about that.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page497" title="497"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus shook his head. “That’s a topic for powwow. Tonight should be a happy occasion. Gods know we’ve earned one.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, in that case,” Kimimela said, eyes twinkling, “is it perhaps time for you to go back and see <em class="char-i">your lady wife</em>?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela had used an expression in patrician Latin that described her mother about as badly as any phrase possibly could. Marcellinus grinned and pinched her. “Gods, yes. I’ve certainly spent enough time enduring <em class="char-i">your</em> company.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela back-kicked him, which he leaned into and blocked with his forearm, and they set off to thread their way through the crowd to the blankets at the front of the Great Plaza where Tahtay and his chiefs and elders would eventually come down to sprawl and eat. As they walked, Marcellinus nodded to men and women he had fought alongside and flown with, smiled at the members of the perennially young brickworks gang, even bowed and stopped to exchange a few words with an Onondaga warrior. Really, he knew a <em class="char-i">lot</em> of people in this city now.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Great Juno. Everyone you know is in between us and where we want to be.” Kimimela slid between two families whose members were cheerfully shouting at one another, having already sampled the mash beer, and grumbled, “If we’d been up on the mound with Tahtay and the others, this would be much easier.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m an outlander,” Marcellinus reminded her. “A private citizen. Not appropriate for me to be up there.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She blew a cheerful raspberry. “Futete. Merda, that, and you know it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Bad words, Kimi…” He shoved her before she could poke him again.</p>
<p class="para-p">A dragon ship had arrived back at Vinlandia just weeks beforehand with the news that the Imperator had survived his journey across the Atlanticus. The longship had also brought a parchment decree from the Senate confirming Marcellinus’s elevation as ambassador to Nova Hesperia, a second decree confirming the annulment of the Damnatio Memoriae on the 33rd Hesperian Legion, and a handwritten letter from Hadrianus to Marcellinus.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page498" title="498"/>
<p class="para-p">As expected, the Imperator had arrived back in Roma to be greeted by jubilation at his great military victory. The Senate had rejoiced to hear how his legions had killed the Khan and smashed the Mongol army. Once all the arrangements were made, Hadrianus and Agrippa would enjoy a great triumph, parading through the streets of Roma. Several weeks of gladiatorial games would follow.</p>
<p class="para-p">By adding Nova Hesperia to the Roman map as an ally and protected state, the Imperator had achieved part of his original ambition. The sun now set a good deal farther west on the Imperium than it had just a few years before. And if Hadrianus’s influence over his new ally was looser than normal and communications with his ambassador were rather limited, that was surely just a function of Cahokia’s immense distance from Urbs Roma.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was true enough that Marcellinus went to the smoke lodge with the elders three times out of four. True enough that he could be included in any clan chief discussion that interested him. Doubly true that on Roma’s inevitable return he would again step up to adopt a central role. But it was also true that these days Marcellinus wanted nothing more than to tinker in his workshops in the afternoons, chatter with his friends in the evenings, and enjoy his nights and mornings with Sintikala. If he ever felt in need of a little gratuitous terror, he could get himself launched under an Eagle craft with Kimimela and Sintikala with a Falling Leaf on his back for safety. There he would wobble around a thousand feet above the city and eventually fumble his way back down to earth again, sweating and exhilarated.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Ooh, ooh,” Kimimela said as they approached the blankets. “Wait, stop. Sinopa of the Blackfoot is here.”</p>
<p class="para-p">As she halted him, Marcellinus peered between the dozen or so people who still stood between them and the blankets. Despite what Kimimela had said earlier, Tahtay had only just that moment arrived, talking in a relaxed way to the Tadodaho. Sintikala, Chenoa, and Enopay were laughing together over something, which in itself was a sight rare enough to be disconcerting. Akecheta and Hanska had shown up and were looking around, even more awkward than Marcellinus in social settings; fortunately, they soon saw Isleifur Bjarnason, hand in hand with Sooleawa of the Hidatsa, and hurried over to talk to them.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page499" title="499"/>
<p class="para-p">With Sooleawa and Isleifur stood three young men of the Blackfoot tribe. Marcellinus nodded. “Sinopa is the exceptionally ugly young brave with the tattoos? Don’t hit me again, Kimi, or I’ll sneak off to the longhouse and cut all the sinews on your Hawk.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What do I say to him?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus shook his head. “ ‘Hello’?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, I’ve <em class="char-i">met</em> him already…Help me?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Good grief.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sorry, I got distracted. Look, Wachiwi is sitting with Pezi and some Oneida braves. Laughing. And now I <em class="char-i">know</em> the Hesperian League has a bright future.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela almost stamped her foot. “Wanageeska! Hear me! You must assist me in greeting Sinopa of the Blackfoot!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Kimimela, you will be chief of the Hawk clan one day. Do you tell me now that you lack courage?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala had seen Marcellinus. Touching Chenoa on the arm in farewell, she hurried forward. Kimimela sighed. “I see that <em class="char-i">once again</em> I must do everything myself.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps not for long,” Marcellinus said, and the next moment Sintikala had grabbed him in an embrace that squeezed all the air from his lungs but was still exhilarating. The traditional Cahokian prudishness about public displays of affection be damned: Marcellinus kissed her.</p>
<p class="para-p">“And so I go,” Kimimela said. “Quickly.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus thought of hugging Enopay as well but instead honored him with a deep Roman bow, which the young man blinked at and then returned with exactly the correct Roman level of formality. “Ambassador Eyanosa.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page500" title="500"/>
<p class="para-p">“Enopay. You are well?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala turned to talk to Sooleawa. Enopay’s eyes followed Kimimela regretfully. “Where is she going?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Merely an errand of diplomacy to the Blackfoot.” Kimimela had reached her target now, showing not a hint of hesitation, and by the look on Sinopa’s face he was delighted to see her. “You all grow up so fast.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Even me?” Enopay asked hopefully.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You’re right. Never mind.” Marcellinus spotted Napayshni, who was waiting inconspicuously at the edge of the gathering, and beckoned him over. Eyes conspiratorial, Napayshni delivered him a pot of very good beer and withdrew.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus drank deeply. “Ah, it’s good to have adjutants.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I, too, miss Roma,” Enopay said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked at him sideways. “Ha.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And you do not?”</p>
<p class="para-p">He hesitated. After his flippancy with Kimimela he was inclined to duck the question with a jest and beckon for a second beer, but Enopay’s expression was serious. “I do not miss the legions. I do not miss Lucius Agrippa overmuch. And I do not miss war. But I think maybe you speak of the city of Roma across the big water and not the Roman Imperium that wishes to own the world.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay watched him with those alert eyes that missed nothing.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I don’t know, Enopay. I don’t want to live in Roma, or anywhere other than right here in Cahokia. And so I would fear to even visit Roma, for if I did, I might never be able to get away to come back here again afterward.” He turned to face Enopay so that the boy could see his eyes. “But sometimes I do miss the grandeur of the Forum. I miss the Seven Hills, and the baths, and, yes, the great aqueducts. I do wonder how Vestilia lives now. I miss Greeks and Aegyptians and Africans and some of the men I met in Galicia-Volhynia, Khwarezmia, and Sindh. And there’s a Briton I wouldn’t mind seeing again. So yes, I do think about it. And you?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I miss the great ships and the shine and gleam of it all. The…pageantry?” Enopay looked glum. “My life will be a poor thing if I never again see anything as grand as a quinquereme.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page501" title="501"/>
<p class="para-p">“You will. I am sure.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And I miss the big talk. The Roman confidence. The idea that nothing is impossible.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That confidence is a two-edged sword.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Surely, but it is also invigorating.” Enopay sat up straight. “All right now. Enough moping. To business.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Business?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Serious talk of the future. Here is what will happen to us all. I have seen it in a dream, and so I know that it is true.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus laughed. “Juno, Enopay. I don’t believe you have ever suffered a prophetic dream.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, not when I was asleep. But here is what I believe when I am awake.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay took a long look around the bustle and feasting that surrounded them in the plaza, the smoke and food, all wrapped in the laughter of Hesperians in the dusk light. “Tahtay will be happy at last. He will be a strong leader to Cahokia and to the Hesperian League, as we always knew he would.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Always?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“In another year the elders and chiefs of Cahokia will grant him the title of Great Sun Man, and Tahtay will accept it. He will rule wisely, but only when he needs to. And Taianita will bear him many strong children. They will run so fast that nobody can catch them, and grow up to be warriors.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Kimimela may love her young Blackfoot for a while, or perhaps someone else, but she will not marry. Instead she will become the chief of the Hawk clan, and sooner rather than later, because Sintikala will yield her position as chief long before she gets old. Sintikala will not become Ojinjintka, who led her clan until the bitter, creaky end. Sintikala has much else to enjoy. Ah, good; I see from your eyes that you and she have discussed this.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus grinned and said nothing. Enopay continued. “As chief of the Hawk clan, Kimimela will stand by Tahtay’s side, just as Sintikala stood by Great Sun Man’s side and now stands by Tahtay’s, and Kimimela and Tahtay will then be the mother and father of Cahokia. And meanwhile you and Sintikala will live a long and happy life together, and you will always fly. Even when you are on the ground.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page502" title="502"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus raised his eyebrows. “Now you write poetry?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Where you two are concerned, somebody has to.” Enopay checked to make sure Sintikala could not overhear him but switched to Latin anyway as he continued. “Marcellinus and Sintikala are perfect together. It is beautiful to see. And the rest of us had to wait <em class="char-i">so long</em> for the two of you to realize it, because you are both so amazingly stubborn.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I wanted it sooner,” Marcellinus said. “We did lose a lot of time.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, you are still young,” Enopay said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus cocked an eye at him. “You say so?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Fifty-one winters is not old. You still have much time. Look at Howahkan. Nahimana. Matoshka. More ancient than the hills and still hobbling around annoying people.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“May all the gods hear your wisdom,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay looked at him very seriously. “I am not as young as you think I am, Eyanosa. And you are not as old as you think you are.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded. “And what of Enopay the Bold? I think he will do many, many things.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Will he?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“At harvest, Enopay counts grain. In war, he counts soldiers. In peace, he counts the days and nights and watches where the sun sets, for he is something of a shaman, but without believing the wild ideas that shamans believe. Tell me, Enopay, is today really midsummer?”</p>
<p class="para-p">For the first time, Enopay looked impressed. “I did not know you had seen me doing that. Yes, Youtin counts true. The sun stands still on the horizon when it sets and will go no farther north. It is midsummer.” He looked smug. “Yet for years we have not had a Midwinter Feast on the real midwinter day, because when it is so cold, Youtin stays abed too long in the mornings, and when he rises, he shivers so much that he cannot keep good count.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page503" title="503"/>
<p class="para-p">“And perhaps, in addition to studying the heavens, Enopay will write down the first history of Cahokia and the mound-builders, or a geography of Hesperia on a series of scrolls for the libraries of Roma and Alexandria.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That sounds like a great deal of finger-talk.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And he will go to Roma to see all of its wonders. Perhaps even as an ambassador for Hesperia.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay looked at him very seriously. “Perhaps I will. I want to see everything, Gaius Marcellinus. I want to see the whole world.”</p>
<p class="para-p">It was rare that Enopay called him anything other than Eyanosa. For a moment, Marcellinus felt oddly sad. Despite his earlier joke, Enopay <em class="char-i">was</em> growing up.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay was watching him. “It is wrong that I should feel such a thing?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No. Never.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay looked sad, too. “But when I go to Roma, you will not come with me?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus considered it again. “I do not know. In truth, perhaps that depends on Roma as much as on me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">For now, Marcellinus appeared to be safe. But an Imperator could always be deposed, or die at dinner in his palace choking on a stuffed dormouse, or simply change his mind. Who could say?</p>
<p class="para-p">The Senate might demand Hesperian gold. Or its army might once again attempt to acquire Cahokian wings and liquid fire to wage war in Europa or Asia. Who could predict Roma’s future policy toward the huge and mostly “unexploited” continent of Nova Hesperia? Their peace and freedom might prove to be short-lived.</p>
<p class="para-p">But if Aelfric were here, the Briton would tell Marcellinus not to fret over a future he could not control. After all, Roma still had the other sons of Chinggis Khan to deal with. Hadrianus might have his hands full for many years to come.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay was trying to read his eyes. “Of course. Roma is capricious. But you do not rule it out?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Even if he could be sure of his reception, to go to Roma, Marcellinus would need to leave Sintikala and Kimimela behind and be away from Cahokia for two years or more. He could not imagine being willing to make such a sacrifice.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page504" title="504"/>
<p class="para-p">But many things about his current situation would have been impossible to predict twelve winters ago, or five, or three. “No, I do not rule it out.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala and Sooleawa hugged, and the young Hidatsa woman skipped back to Isleifur Bjarnason. Sintikala turned to survey them, then winked at Enopay and said: “You are too serious, Wanageeska. As always.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus laughed aloud. “You say so? <em class="char-i">Sintikala</em> says such a thing?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I say it.” She met his eye with a fierce and smoldering gaze. “But for you, I am Sisika.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Mortified, Enopay looked around him. “Perhaps I should go.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You should not.” Sintikala put her hand on Enopay’s arm, shook her head, smiled. “The Wanageeska and I will behave.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You will stay, and we will eat together,” Marcellinus said. “No, wait: you will go and rescue Tahtay from the Tadodaho and invite him and Taianita to join us, and then you will encourage Kimimela to return here, too, with her very unattractive new friend of the Blackfoot if she must, and <em class="char-i">then</em> you will stay.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Will I?” Enopay glanced at them both, still nervous.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, you will,” Sintikala said. “We have spoken.”</p></div></body></html>

<div id="filepos528911" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Tea and Vengeance</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It’s a beautiful country, isn’t it?” asked Bayaz, staring up at the rugged fells on either side of the road.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Their horses’ hooves thumped slowly along the track, the steady sound at odds with Logen’s unease. “Is it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, it’s a hard country, of course, to those who don’t know its ways. A tough country, and unforgiving. But there’s something noble there too.” The First of the Magi swept his arm across the view, breathed in the cold air with relish. “It has honesty, integrity. The best steel doesn’t always shine the brightest.” He glanced over, swaying gently in his saddle. “You should know that.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I can’t say I see the beauty of it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No? What do you see?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen let his eyes wander over the steep, grassy slopes, spotted with patches of sedge and brown gorse, studded with outcrops of grey rock and stands of trees. “I see good ground for a battle. Provided you got here first.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Really? How so?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen pointed at a knobbly hilltop. “Archers on the bluff there couldn’t be seen from the road, and you could hide most of your foot in these rocks. A few of the lightest armoured left on the slopes, just to draw the enemy on up the steepest ground there.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He pointed to the thorny bushes that covered the lower slopes. “You’d let them come on a way, then when they were struggling through that gorse, you’d give them the arrows. Shafts falling on you from above like that, that’s no fun at all. They come quicker and further, and they bite deeper. That’d break them up. By the time they got to the rocks they’d be dog-tired and running short on discipline. That would be the time to charge. A bunch of Carls, leaping out of those stones, charging down from above, fresh and keen and screaming like devils, that could break ’em right there.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen narrowed his eyes at the hillside. He’d been on both sides of a surprise like that, and in neither case was the memory a pleasant one. “But if they had a mind to hold, a few horsemen in those trees could finish it up. A few Named Men, a few hard fighters, bearing down on you from a place you never expected them, that’s a terrifying thing. That’d make them run. But tired as they’d be, they wouldn’t run too fast. That means prisoners, and prisoners might mean ransoms, or at least enemies cheaply killed. I see a slaughter, or a victory worth the singing, depending which side you’re on. That’s what I see.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz smiled, head nodding with the slow movement of his horse. “Was it Stolicus who said the ground must be a general’s best friend, or it becomes his worst enemy?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I never heard of him, but he was right enough. This is good ground for an army, providing you got here first. Getting there first is the trick.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Indeed. We don’t have an army, however.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“These trees could hide a few horsemen even better than a lot.” Logen glanced sidelong at the wizard. He was slouched happily in the saddle, enjoying a pleasant ride in the country. “I don’t think Bethod will have appreciated your advice, and I had scores enough with him already. He got wounded where he feels it most, in his pride. He’ll want vengeance. Want it badly.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah yes, vengeance, that most widespread of Northern pastimes. Its popularity never seems to wane.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen stared grimly around at the trees, the rocks, the folds in the valley’s sides, the many hiding places. “There’ll be men out in these hills, looking for us. Small bands of skilled and battle-hardened men, well mounted and well armed, familiar with the land. Now Bethod has finished all his enemies there’s nowhere in the North out of his reach. They might be waiting there,” he pointed off towards some rocks by the road, “or in those trees, or those.” Malacus Quai, riding up ahead with the packhorse, glanced nervously around. “They could be anywhere.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Does that frighten you?” asked Bayaz.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Everything frightens me, and it’s well that it does. Fear is a good friend to the hunted, it’s kept me alive this long. The dead are fearless, and I don’t care to join them. He’ll send men to the library too.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh yes, to burn my books and so on.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Does that frighten you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not much. The stones by the gate have the word of Juvens on them, and that is not to be denied, even now. No one with violence in mind can come near. I imagine Bethod’s men will wander around the lake in the rain until they run out of food, all the while thinking how very strange it is that they cannot find so large a thing as a library. No,” said the wizard happily, scratching at his beard. “I would concentrate on our own predicament. What happens, do you think, if we’re caught?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bethod will kill us, and in the most unpleasant manner he can think of. Unless he has it in mind to be merciful, and let us off with a warning.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That doesn’t seem likely.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’ve been thinking the same thing. Our best chance is to make for the Whiteflow, try to get across the river into Angland, and trust to luck we aren’t seen.” Logen didn’t like trusting to luck, the very word left a sour taste. He peered up at the cloudy sky. “We could do with some bad weather. A healthy downpour could hide us nicely.” The skies had been pissing on him for weeks, but now that he needed rain they refused to produce a drop.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Malacus Quai was looking over his shoulder at them, his eyes big and round with worry. “Shouldn’t we try to move faster?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Perhaps,” said Logen, patting the neck of his horse, “but that would tire the horses, and we may need all the speed we can get later. We could hide in the day and travel by night, but then we risk getting lost. We’re better as we are. Move slowly and hope we aren’t seen.” He frowned at the hilltop. “Hope we haven’t been seen already.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hmm,” said Bayaz, “then this might be the best time to tell you. That witch Caurib isn’t half the fool I pretended she was.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen felt a sinking sensation. “No?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No, for all her paint and gold and chat about the utmost north, she knows what she is about. The long eye, they call it. An old trick, but effective. She has been watching us.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“She knows where we are?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“She knows when we left, more than likely, and in what direction we were heading.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That does nothing for our chances.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I should say not.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shit.” Logen caught some movement in the trees to their left, and he snatched hold of the hilt of his sword. A couple of birds took to the skies. He waited, heart in his mouth. Nothing. He let his hand drop back. “We should have killed them while we had the chance. All three of them.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But we didn’t, and there it is.” Bayaz looked over at Logen. “If they do catch us, what’s your plan?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Run. And hope our horses are the faster.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And this one?” asked Bayaz.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The wind blew keenly through the hollow in spite of the trees, making the flames of the campfire flicker and dance. Malacus Quai hunched his shoulders and drew his blanket tight around them. He peered at the short stem that Bayaz was holding up to him, forehead crinkled with concentration.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Erm…” This was the fifth plant, and the miserable apprentice had yet to get one of them right. “Is that… er… Ilyith?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ilyith?” echoed the wizard, his face giving no clue as to whether it was the right answer. He was merciless as Bethod where his apprentice was concerned.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Perhaps?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hardly.” The apprentice closed his eyes and sighed for the fifth time that evening. Logen felt for him, he really did, but there was nothing to be done. “Ursilum, in the old tongue, the round-leafed kind.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, yes, of course, Ursilum, it was at the end of my tongue the whole time.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“If the name was at the end of your tongue, then the uses of the plant cannot be far behind, eh?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The apprentice narrowed his eyes and looked hopefully up towards the night sky, as though the answer might be written in the stars. “Is it… for aches in the joints?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No, it is decidedly not. I am afraid your aching joints will still be troubling you.” Bayaz turned the stem slowly round in his fingers. “Ursilum has no uses, not that I know of. It’s just a plant.” And he tossed it away into the bushes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Just a plant,” echoed Quai, shaking his head. Logen sighed and rubbed his tired eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m sorry, Master Ninefingers, are we boring you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What does it matter?” asked Logen, throwing his hands up in the air. “Who cares about the name of a plant with no use?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz smiled. “A fair point. Tell us, Malacus, what does it matter?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“If a man seeks to change the world, he should first understand it.” The apprentice trotted the words out as if by rote, evidently relieved to be asked a question he knew the answer to. “The smith must learn the ways of metals, the carpenter the ways of wood, or their work will be of but little worth. Base magic is wild and dangerous, for it comes from the Other Side, and to draw from the world below is fraught with peril. The Magus tempers magic with knowledge, and thus produces High Art, but like the smith or the carpenter, he should only seek to change that which he understands. With each thing he learns, his power is increased. So must the Magus strive to learn all, to understand the world entire. The tree is only as strong as its root, and knowledge is the root of power.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Don’t tell me, Juvens’ </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Principles of Art</span></span><span class="calibre3">?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The very first lines,” said Bayaz.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Forgive me for saying so, but I’ve been on this world for more than thirty years, and I’ve yet to understand a single thing that’s happened. To know the world completely? To understand everything? That’s quite a task.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Magus chuckled. “An impossible one, to be sure. To truly know and understand even a blade of grass is the study of a lifetime, and the world is ever changing. That is why we tend to specialise.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So what did you choose?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Fire,” said Bayaz, gazing happily into the flames, the light dancing on his bald head. “Fire, and force, and will. But even in my chosen fields, after countless long years of study, I remain a novice. The more you learn, the more you realise how little you know. Still, the struggle itself is worthwhile. Knowledge is the root of power, after all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So with enough knowledge, you Magi can do anything?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz frowned. “There are limits. And there are rules.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Like the First Law?” Master and apprentice glanced up at Logen as one. “It’s forbidden to speak with devils, am I right?” It was plain that Quai didn’t remember his fevered outburst, his mouth was open with surprise. Bayaz’ eyes only narrowed a little, with the faintest trace of suspicion.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Why, yes you are,” said the First of the Magi. “It is forbidden to touch the Other Side direct. The First Law must apply to all, without exception. As must the Second.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Which is?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It is forbidden to eat the flesh of men.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen raised an eyebrow. “You wizards get up to some strange stuff.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz smiled. “Oh, you don’t know the half of it.” He turned to his apprentice, holding up a lumpy brown root. “And now, Master Quai, would you be good enough to tell me the name of this?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen couldn’t help grinning to himself. He knew this one.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Come, come, Master Quai, we don’t have all night.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen wasn’t able to stand the apprentice’s misery any longer. He leaned toward him, pretending to poke at the fire with a stick, coughed to conceal his words and whispered, “Crow’s Foot,” under his breath. Bayaz was a good distance away, and the wind was still rustling in the trees. There was no way the Magus could have heard him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Quai played his part well. He continued to peer at the root, brow knitted in thought. “Is it Crow’s Foot?” he ventured.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz raised an eyebrow. “Why, yes it is. Well done, Malacus. And can you tell me its uses?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen coughed again. “Wounds,” he whispered, looking carelessly off into the bushes, one hand shielding his mouth. He might not know too much about plants, but on the subject of wounds he had a wealth of experience.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I believe it’s good for wounds,” said Quai slowly.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Excellent, Master Quai. Crow’s Foot is correct. And it is good for wounds. I am glad to see we are making some progress after all.” He cleared his throat. “It does seem curious that you should use that name however. They only call this Crow’s Foot north of the mountains. I certainly never taught you that name. I wonder who it is you know, from that part of the world?” He glanced over at Logen. “Have you ever considered a career in the magical arts, Master Ninefingers?” He narrowed his eyes at Quai once more. “I may have space for an apprentice.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Malacus hung his head. “Sorry, Master Bayaz.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You are indeed. Perhaps you could clean the pots for us. That task may be better suited to your talents.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Quai reluctantly shrugged off his blanket, collected the dirty bowls and shuffled off through the brush towards the stream. Bayaz bent over the pot on the fire, adding some dried-up leaves to the bubbling water. The flickering light of the flames caught the underside of his face, the steam curled around his bald head. All in all, he looked quite the part.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What is that?” asked Logen, reaching for his pipe. “Some spell? Some potion? Some great work of High Art?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Tea.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Eh?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Leaves of a certain plant, boiled up in water. It is considered quite a luxury in Gurkhul.” He poured some of the brew out into a cup. “Would you like to try it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen sniffed at it suspiciously. “Smells like feet.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Suit yourself.” Bayaz shook his head and sat back down beside the fire, wrapping both hands around the steaming cup. “But you’re missing out on one of nature’s greatest gifts to man.” He took a sip and smacked his lips in satisfaction. “Calming to the mind, invigorating to the body. There are few ills a good cup of tea won’t help with.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen pressed a lump of chagga into the bowl of his pipe. “How about an axe in the head?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s one of them,” admitted Bayaz with a grin. “Tell me, Master Ninefingers, why all the blood between you and Bethod? Did you not fight for him many times? Why do you hate each other so?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen paused as he was sucking smoke from the pipe, let his breath out. “There are reasons,” he said stiffly. The wounds of that time were still raw. He didn’t like anyone picking at them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, reasons.” Bayaz looked down at his tea-cup. “And what of your reasons? Does this feud not cut both ways?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Perhaps.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But you are willing to wait?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’ll have to be.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hmm. You are very patient, for a Northman.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen thought of Bethod, and his loathsome sons, and the many good men they’d killed for their ambitions. The men he’d killed for their ambitions. He thought of the Shanka, and his family, and the ruins of the village by the sea. He thought of all his dead friends. He sucked at his teeth and stared at the fire.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’ve settled a few scores in my time, but it only led to more. Vengeance can feel fine, but it’s a luxury. It doesn’t fill your belly, or keep the rain off. To fight my enemies I need friends behind me, and I’m clean out of friends. You have to be realistic. It’s been a while since my ambitions went beyond getting through each day alive.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz laughed, his eyes glittering in the firelight. “What?” asked Logen, handing the pipe across to him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No offence, but you are an endless source of surprises. Not at all what I was expecting. You are quite the riddle.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Me?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh yes! The Bloody-Nine,” he whispered, opening his eyes up wide. “That’s one bastard of a reputation you’re carrying, my friend. The stories they tell! One bastard of a name! Why, mothers scare their children with it!” Logen said nothing. There was no denying it. Bayaz sucked slowly on the pipe, then blew out a long plume of smoke. “I’ve been thinking about the day that Prince Calder paid us a visit.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen snorted. “I try not to spare him too much thought.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Nor I, but it wasn’t his behaviour that interested me, it was yours.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It was? I don’t remember doing a thing.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz pointed the stem of the pipe at Logen from across the fire. “Ah, but that is my point exactly. I have known many fighting men, soldiers and generals and champions and whatnot. A great fighter must act quickly, decisively, whether with his own arm or with an army, for he who strikes first often strikes last. So fighters come to rely on their baser instincts, to answer always with violence, to become proud and brutal.” Bayaz passed the pipe back to Logen. “But whatever the stories, you are not such a one.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I know plenty who’d disagree.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Perhaps, but the fact remains, Calder slighted you, and you did nothing. So you know when you should act, and act quickly, but you also know when not to. That shows restraint, and a calculating mind.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Perhaps I was just afraid.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of him? Come now. You didn’t seem afraid of Scale and he’s a deal more worrying. And you walked forty miles with my apprentice over your back, and that shows courage, and compassion too. A rare combination, indeed. Violence and restraint, calculation and compassion—and you speak to the spirits too.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen raised an eyebrow. “Not often, and only when there’s no one else around. Their talk is dull, and not half so flattering as yours.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hah. That’s true. The spirits have little to say to men, I understand, though I have never spoken with them; I have not the gift. Few have these days.” He took another swallow from his cup, peering at Logen over the rim. “I can scarcely think of another one alive.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Malacus stumbled from the trees, shivering, and set the wet bowls down. He grabbed his blanket, wrapped it tightly around him, then peered hopefully at the steaming pot on the fire. “Is that tea?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz ignored him. “Tell me, Master Ninefingers, in all the time since you arrived at my library, you have never once asked me why I sent for you, or why now we are wandering through the North in peril of our lives. That strikes me as odd.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not really. I don’t want to know.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Don’t want to?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“All my life I’ve sought to know things. What’s on the other side of the mountains? What are my enemies thinking? What weapons will they use against me? What friends can I trust?” Logen shrugged. “Knowledge may be the root of power, but each new thing I’ve learned has left me worse off.” He sucked again on the pipe, but it was finished. He tapped the ashes out onto the ground. “Whatever it is you want from me I will try to do, but I don’t want to know until it’s time. I’m sick of making my own decisions. They’re never the right ones. Ignorance is the sweetest medicine, my father used to say. I don’t want to know.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz stared at him. It was the first time Logen had seen the First of the Magi look at all surprised. Malacus Quai cleared his throat. “I’d like to know,” he said in a small voice, looking hopefully up at his master.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes,” murmured Bayaz, “but you don’t get to ask.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was around midday that it all went wrong. Logen was just starting to think that they might make it to the Whiteflow, maybe even live out the week. It felt as if he lost his concentration for just a moment. Unfortunately, it was the one moment that mattered.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Still, it was well done, you had to give them that. They’d chosen their spot carefully, and tied rags around their horse’s hooves, to muffle the sound. Threetrees might have seen it coming, if he’d been with them, but he had an eye for the ground like no other. The Dogman might have smelled them, if he’d been there, but he had the nose for it. The fact was, neither of them were there. The dead are no help at all.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There were three horsemen, waiting for them as they rounded a blind corner, well armed and armoured, dirty faces but clean weapons, veterans each man. The one on the right was thickset and powerful-looking, with almost no neck. The one on the left was tall and gaunt with small, hard eyes. Both of them had round helmets, coats of weathered mail, and long spears lowered and ready. Their leader sat on his horse like a bag of turnips, slouched in the saddle with the ease of the expert horseman. He nodded to Logen. “Ninefingers! The Brynn! The Bloody-Nine! It’s right good to see you again.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Blacktoe,” muttered Logen, forcing a friendly smile onto his face. “It’d warm my heart to see you too, if things were different.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But they are as they are.” The old warrior’s eyes moved slowly over Bayaz, Quai, and Logen as he spoke, taking in their weapons, or the lack of them, working out his game. A stupider opponent could have evened up the odds, but Blacktoe was a Named Man, and no fool. His eyes came to rest on Logen’s hand as it crept slowly across his body towards the hilt of his sword, and he shook his head slowly. “None of your tricks, Bloody-Nine. You can see we’ve got you.” And he nodded over at the trees behind them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen’s heart sank even lower. Two more riders had appeared and were trotting forwards to complete the trap, their muffled hooves barely making a sound on the soft ground by the road. Logen chewed his lip. Blacktoe was right, damn him. The four horsemen closed in, lowered spear-points swaying, faces cold, minds set to the task. Malacus Quai stared at them with frightened eyes, his horse shying back. Bayaz smiled pleasantly as though they were his oldest friends. Logen would have liked a touch of the wizard’s composure. His own heart was hammering, his mouth was sour.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Blacktoe nudged his horse forward, one hand gripping the shaft of his axe, the other resting on his knee, not even using the reins. He was a masterful horseman, famous for it. That’s what happens when a man loses all his toes to the frost. Riding is quicker than walking, that has to be admitted, but when it came to fighting Logen preferred to keep his feet firmly on the ground. “Better be coming with us now,” said the old warrior, “better all round.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen could hardly agree, but the odds were stacked high against him. A sword may have a voice, as Bayaz had said, but a spear is a damn good thing for poking a man off a horse, and there were four of them closing in around him. He was caught—outnumbered, off-guard, and with the wrong tools for the task. Yet again. Best to play for time, and hope some chance might show itself. Logen cleared his throat, doing his best to take the fear out of his voice. “Never thought you’d make your peace with Bethod, Blacktoe, not you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old warrior scratched at his long, matted beard. “I was one of the last, truth be told, but I knelt in the end, same as all the rest. Can’t say I liked it any, but there it is. Best let me have the blade, Ninefingers.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What about Old Man Yawl? You telling me he bows to Bethod? Or did you just find a master to suit you better?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Blacktoe didn’t get upset by the jibe, not in the least. He just looked sad, and tired. “Yawl’s dead, as though you didn’t know. Most of ’em are. Bethod doesn’t suit me much at all as a master, and nor do his sons. No man likes licking Scales fat arse, or Calder’s skinny one, you should know that. Now give up the sword, the day’s wasting and we’ve ground to cover. We can talk just as well with you unarmed.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yawl’s dead?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Aye,” said Blacktoe suspiciously. “He offered Bethod a duel. Didn’t you hear? The Feared done for him.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Feared?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Where’ve you been, under a mountain?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“More or less. What’s this Feared?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I don’t know what he is.” Blacktoe leaned from his saddle and spat in the grass. “I heard he’s not a man at all. They say that bitch Caurib dug him out from under a hill. Who knows? Leastways, he’s Bethod’s new champion, and far nastier even than the last, no offence.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“None at all,” said Logen. The man with no neck had moved in close. A little too close perhaps, the point of his spear was hovering only a foot or two away. Close enough for Logen to grab a hold of. Maybe. “Old Man Yawl was a strong hand.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Aye. That’s why we followed him. But it done him no good. This Feared broke him. Broke him bad, like he was no more’n a dog. Left him alive, if you could call it that, so we could learn from his mistake, but he didn’t live long. Most of us knelt right then, those with wives and sons to think on. No sense in putting it off. There’s a few of them still, up in the mountains, who won’t bow to Bethod. That moon-worshipping madman Crummock-i-Phail and his hillmen, and a few beside. But not many. And those there are, Bethod’s got plans for.” Blacktoe held out a big, calloused hand. “Better let me have the blade, Bloody-Nine. Left hand only, if you please, slow as slow and none of your tricks. Better all round.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">So that was it. Out of time. Logen wrapped the three fingers of his left hand round the hilt of his sword, the cold metal pressing into his palm. The big man’s spear point edged a little closer. The tall one had relaxed a little, confident they had him. His spear was pointing up into the air, unready. There was no telling what the two behind were doing. The desire to glance over his shoulder was almost irresistible, but Logen forced himself to look ahead.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I always had respect for you, Ninefingers, even though we stood on different sides. I’ve no feud with you. But Bethod wants vengeance, he’s drunk on it, and I swore to serve.” Blacktoe looked him sadly in the eye. “I’m sorry it’s me. For what it’s worth.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Likewise,” muttered Logen, “I’m sorry it’s you.” He slid the sword slowly from the scabbard. “For what it’s worth,” and he snapped his arm out, smashing the sword’s pommel into Blacktoe’s mouth. The old warrior gave a squawk as the dull metal crunched into his teeth and tumbled backwards out of the saddle, his axe flying from his hand and clattering into the road. Logen grabbed hold of the shaft of the big man’s spear, just below the blade.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Go!” he bellowed at Quai, but the apprentice only stared back, blinking. The man with no neck pulled hard at the spear, nearly jerking Logen out of the saddle, but he kept his grip. He reared up in the stirrups, raising the sword high above his head. Neckless took one hand from his spear, his eyes going wide, and held it up on an instinct. Logen swung the sword down with all his strength.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was shocked by the sharpness of it. It took the big man’s arm off just below the elbow then struck into his shoulder, cleaving through the fur and the mail beneath and splitting him to his stomach, near in half. Blood showered across the road, spattering in the face of Logen’s horse. It was trained for riding but not for war and it reared and span around, kicking and plunging in a panic. It was the best Logen could do to stay on top of the damn thing. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Bayaz smack Quai’s horse on the rump, and it sped off with the apprentice bouncing in the saddle, the packhorse galloping along behind.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Then everything was a mess of plunging and snorting beasts, clashing and scraping metal, curses and cries. Battle. A familiar place, but no less terrifying for that. Logen clung to the reins with his right hand as his horse bucked and thrashed, swinging the sword wildly round his head, more to scare his enemies than hurt them. Every moment he expected the jolt and searing pain as he was stuck through with a spear, then the ground to rush up and smack him in the face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He saw Quai and Bayaz galloping away down the road, hotly pursued by the tall man, his spear couched under his arm. He saw Blacktoe rolling to his feet, spitting blood, scrambling for his axe. He saw the two men who’d come from behind fighting for control of their own twisting horses, spears waving in their hands. He saw the body of the one he’d just killed loll in half and topple slowly out of the saddle, blood pouring out over the muddy ground.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen squawked as he felt a spear-point dig into the back of his shoulder, and he was shoved forward, almost over his horse’s head. Then he realised he was facing down the road, and still alive. He dug his heels into the flanks of his horse and it sped away, sending mud flying from its hooves and into the faces of the men behind. He fumbled the sword across into his right hand, nearly dropping the reins and falling into the road. He shrugged his shoulder but the wound didn’t feel too bad—he could still move the arm alright.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m still alive. Still alive.” The road flashed by beneath him, the wind stinging his eyes. He was making ground on the tall man—the rags on his horse’s hooves were slowing him down now, slipping on the muddy ground. Logen gripped the hilt of the sword as hard as he could, raised it behind him. The head of his enemy snapped round, but too late. There was a hollow bonk of metal on metal as sword smashed into helmet, leaving a deep dent and sending the tall man sprawling. His head bounced once against the road, foot still caught in one stirrup, then he came free and tumbled over and over on the grass, arms and legs flopping. His riderless horse galloped on, eyes rolling at Logen as he passed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Still alive.” Logen looked over his shoulder. Blacktoe was back in the saddle and galloping after him, axe raised above his head, tangled hair flying out behind. The two other spearmen were with him, urging their horses forwards, but there was still some distance between them. Logen laughed. Perhaps he’d make it after all. He waved his sword at Blacktoe as the road entered a wood in the valley’s bottom.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m still alive!” he screamed at the top of his voice, and then his horse pulled up so suddenly that Logen was almost flung over its head. It was only by throwing one arm round its neck that he kept his seat at all. As soon as he fell back into the saddle he saw the problem, and it was a bad one.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Several tree trunks had been hauled across the road, their branches chopped off and the stumps filed down to vicious points, sticking out in all directions. Two more mailed Carls stood in front, spears at the ready. Even the best of horsemen couldn’t have jumped that barrier, and Logen wasn’t the best of horsemen. Bayaz and his apprentice had reached the same decision. Both sat still on their horses before the barricade, the old man looking puzzled, the young one simply scared.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen fingered the grip of his sword and cast desperately around, peering into the trees for some way out. He saw more men now. Archers. One, then two, then three of them, creeping slowly forward on both sides of the road, arrows nocked and strings drawn back.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen turned round in the saddle, but Blacktoe and his two companions were trotting up, there was no escape that way. They reined in a few strides away, well out of reach of Logen’s sword. His shoulders slumped. The chase was done. Blacktoe leaned over and spat some blood onto the ground. “Alright, Bloody-Nine, that’s as far as you go.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Funny thing,” muttered Logen, looking down at the long grey blade of the sword, dashed and spattered with red. “All that time I fought for Bethod against you, and now you fight for him against me. Seems we’re never on the same side, and he’s the only winner. Funny thing.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Aye,” mumbled Blacktoe through his bloody lips, “funny.” But no one was laughing. Blacktoe and his Carls had faces hard as death, Quai looked on the verge of tears. Only Bayaz, for reasons beyond understanding, still had his customary good humour. “Alright, Ninefingers, get off the horse. Bethod wants you alive, but he’ll take you dead, if he has to. Down! Now!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen’s thoughts began to turn to how they might escape, once he’d given up. Blacktoe wasn’t like to make a mistake once he had them. Logen would likely be kicked half to death for the fight he’d given them already, if they didn’t take his kneecaps off. They’d be trussed up tight like chickens for the slaughter. He pictured himself flung down on the stones with half a mile of chain around him, Bethod smiling down from his throne, Calder and Scale laughing, probably poking at him with something sharp.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen looked around. He looked at the cold arrowheads and the cold spear-points, and the cold eyes of the men pointing them. There was no way out of this little spot.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Alright, you win.” Logen threw his sword down, point first. He had it in mind that it would bite into the soil and stand there, swaying back and forth, but it toppled over and clattered against the dirt. It was that sort of day. He slowly swung one leg over the saddle and slid down into the road.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s better. Now the rest of you.” Quai instantly slithered off his horse and stood there, glancing nervously up at Bayaz, but the Magus made no move. Blacktoe frowned and hefted his axe. “You too, old man.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I prefer to ride.” Logen winced. That was not the right answer. Any moment now Blacktoe would give the order. The bowstrings would sing and the First of the Magi would drop into the road, stuck full of arrows, probably still with that infuriating smile on his dead face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But the order never came. There was no word of command, no strange incantation, no arcane gestures. The air around Bayaz’ shoulders seemed to shimmer, like the air above the land on a hot day, and Logen felt a strange tugging at his guts.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Then the trees exploded in a wall of searing, blinding, white hot flame. Trunks burst and branches snapped with deafening cracks, venting plumes of brilliant fire and scalding steam. One burning arrow shot high up into the air over Logen’s head, and then the archers were gone, boiled away into the furnace.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen choked and gasped, reeled back in shock and terror, arm up to ward his face from the blistering heat. The barricade was sending up great gouts of fire and blinding sparks, the two men who had been standing near were rolling and thrashing, wreathed in hungry flames, their screams lost in the deafening roar.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The horses plunged and reeled, snorting with mad fear. Blacktoe was flung to the ground for the second time, his flaming axe flying from his hands, and his horse stumbled and fell, crashing down on top of him. One of his companions was even less lucky—thrown straight into the sheets of fire by the road, his despairing cry quickly cut off. Only one stayed upright, and he was lucky enough to be wearing gloves. By some miracle he kept hold of the burning shaft of his spear.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">How he had the presence of mind to charge with the world on fire around him, Logen would never know. Strange things can happen in a fight. He chose Quai as his target, bearing down on him with a snarl, the flaming spear aimed at his chest. The witless apprentice stood there helpless, rooted to the spot. Logen barrelled into him, snatching up his sword, sending Quai rolling across the road with his hands over his head, then he chopped mindlessly at the horse’s legs as it flashed past him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The blade was torn from his fingers and went skittering away, then a hoof slammed into Logen’s injured shoulder and clubbed him into the dirt. The breath was knocked from him and the burning world span crazily around. His blow had its effect though. A few strides further down the road the horses hacked front legs gave way and it stumbled, carried helplessly forward, tumbled and pitched into the flames, horse and rider vanishing together.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen cast about on the ground for the sword. Sizzling leaves whipped across the road, stinging his face and his hands. The heat was a great weight pressing down on him, pulling the sweat out of his skin. He found the bloody grip of the sword, seized hold of it with his torn fingers. He lurched up, staggered round, shouting meaningless sounds of fury, but there was no one left to fight. The flames were gone, as suddenly as they’d arrived, leaving Logen coughing and blinking in the curling smoke.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The silence seemed complete after the roaring noise, the gentle breeze felt icy cold. A wide circle of the trees around them had been reduced to charred and shattered stumps, as though they had burned for hours. The barricade was a sagging heap of grey ash and black splinters. Two corpses lay sprawled nearby, barely recognisable as men, burned down to the bones. The blackened blades of their spears lay in the road, the shafts vanished. Of the archers there was no sign at all. They were soot blown away on the wind. Quai lay motionless on his face with his hands over his head, and beyond him Blacktoe’s horse lay sprawled out on its side, one leg silently twitching, the others still.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well,” said Bayaz, the muffled noise making Logen jump. He’d somehow expected there would never be another sound again. “That’s that.” The First of the Magi swung a leg over his saddle and slid down into the road. His horse stood there, calm and obedient. It hadn’t moved the whole time. “There now, Master Quai, do you see what can be achieved with a proper understanding of plants?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz sounded calm, but his hands were trembling. Trembling badly. He looked haggard, ill, old, like a man who’d dragged a cart ten miles. Logen stared at him, swaying silently back and forth, the sword dangling from his hand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So that’s Art, is it?” His voice sounded very small and far away.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz wiped the sweat from his face. “Of a sort. Hardly very subtle. Still,” and he poked at one of the charred bodies with his boot, “subtlety is wasted on the Northmen.” He grimaced, rubbed at his sunken eyes and peered up the road. “Where the hell did those horses get to?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen heard a ragged groan from the direction of Blacktoe’s fallen mount. He stumbled towards it, tripped and fell to his knees, stumbled towards it again. His shoulder was a ball of pain, his left arm numb, his fingers ripped and bleeding, but Blacktoe was in worse shape. Much worse. He was propped up on his elbows, legs crushed under his horse right to the hips, hands burned to swollen tatters. He had a look of profound puzzlement on his bloody face as he tried, unsuccessfully, to drag himself from under the horse.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’ve fucking killed me,” he whispered, staring open-mouthed at the wreckage of his hands. “I’m all done. I’ll never make it back, and even if I could, what for?” He gave a despairing laugh. “Bethod ain’t half so merciful as he used to be. Better you kill me now, before it starts to hurt. Better all round.” And he slumped back and lay in the road.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen looked up at Bayaz, but there was no help there. “I’m not much at healing,” snapped the wizard, glancing round at the circle of blasted stumps. “I told you we tend to specialise.” He closed his eyes and bent over, hands resting on his knees, breathing hard.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen thought of the floor in Bethod’s hall, and the two princes, laughing and poking. “Alright,” he muttered, standing up and hefting the sword. “Alright.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Blacktoe smiled. “You were right, Ninefingers. I never should have knelt to Bethod. Never. Shit on him and his Feared. It would have been better to die up in the mountains, fighting him to the last. There might have been something fine in that. I just had enough. You can see that, can’t you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I can see that,” muttered Logen. “I’ve had enough myself.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Something fine,” said Blacktoe, staring far up into the grey skies, “I just had enough. So I reckon I earned this. Fair is fair.” He lifted his chin. “Well then. Get it done, lad.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen raised the sword.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m glad it’s you, Ninefingers,” hissed Blacktoe through gritted teeth, “for what it’s worth.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m not.” Logen swung the blade down.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The scorched stumps were still smouldering, smoke curling up into the air, but all was cold now. Logen’s mouth tasted salty, like blood. Perhaps he bit his tongue somewhere. Perhaps it was someone else’s. He threw the sword down and it bounced and clattered, shedding red specks across the dirt. Quai gaped around for a moment, then he folded up and coughed puke into the road. Logen stared down at Blacktoe’s headless corpse. “That was a good man. Better than me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“History is littered with dead good men.” Bayaz knelt stiffly and picked up the sword, wiped the blade on Blacktoe’s coat, then he squinted up the road, peering through the haze of smoke. “We should be moving. Others might be on their way.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen looked at his bloody hands, slowly turning them over and over. They were his hands, no doubt. There was the missing finger. “Nothing’s changed,” he mumbled to himself.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz straightened up, brushing the dirt from his knees. “When has it ever?” He held out the sword out to Logen, hilt first. “I think you’ll still be needing this.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen stared at the blade for a moment. It was clean, dull grey, just as it had always been. Unlike him, it showed not so much as a scratch from the hard use it had seen that day. He didn’t want it back. Not ever.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But he took it anyway.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_20"></div></div></body>

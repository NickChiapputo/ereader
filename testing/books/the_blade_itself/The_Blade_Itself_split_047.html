<div id="filepos1381931" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> The Bloody-Nine</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say that he’s happy. They were leaving, at last. Beyond some vague talk about the Old Empire, and the edge of the World, he had no idea where they were going and he didn’t care. Anywhere but this cursed place would do for him, and the sooner the better.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The latest member of the group didn’t seem to share his good spirits. Luthar, the proud young man from the gate. The one who’d won the sword-game, thanks to Bayaz’ cheating. He’d barely said two words together since he arrived. Just stood there, face rigid and chalky pale, staring out of the window, bolt upright like he had a spear all the way up his arse.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen ambled over to him. If you’re going to travel with a man, and maybe fight alongside him, it’s best to talk, and laugh if you can. That way you can get an understanding, and then a trust. Trust is what binds a band together, and out there in the wilds that can make the difference between living or dying. Building that kind of trust takes time, and effort. Logen reckoned it was best to get started early, and today he had good humour to spare, so he stood next to Luthar and looked out at the park, trying to dream up some common ground in which to plant the seeds of an unlikely friendship.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Beautiful, your home.” He didn’t think it was, but he was short on ideas.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Luthar turned from the window, looked Logen haughtily up and down. “What would you know about it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I reckon one man’s thoughts are worth about as much as another’s.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh,” sneered the young man coldly. “Then I suppose that’s where we differ.” He turned back to the view.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen took a deep breath. The trust might be a while coming. He abandoned Luthar and tried Quai instead, but the apprentice was scarcely more promising: slumped in a chair, frowning at nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen sat down next to him. “Aren’t you looking forward to going home?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Home,” mumbled the apprentice listlessly.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s right, the Old Empire… or wherever.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You don’t know what it’s like there.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You could tell me,” said Logen, hoping to hear something about the peaceful valleys, cities, rivers and whatnot.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bloody. It’s bloody there, and lawless, and life is cheap as dirt.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bloody and lawless. That all had an unpleasantly familiar smack to it. “Isn’t there an Emperor, or something?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There are many, always making war on one another, forging alliances that last a week, or a day, or an hour, before they scramble to be first to stab each other in the back. When one Emperor falls another rises, and another, and another, and meanwhile the hopeless and the dispossessed scavenge and loot and kill on the fringes. The cities dwindle, the great works of the past fall into ruin, the crops go unharvested and the people go hungry. Bloodshed and betrayal, hundreds of years of it. The feuds have become so deep, so complicated, that few can tell any longer who hates who, and no one can say why. There’s no need for reasons any more.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen made one last effort. “You never know. Things might have got better.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Why?” muttered the apprentice. “Why?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen was fumbling for a reply when one of the doors swung briskly open. Bayaz frowned around the room. “Where’s Maljinn?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Quai swallowed. “She left.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I can see she left! I thought I told you to keep her here!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You didn’t tell me how,” muttered the apprentice.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">His master ignored him. “What the hell has become of that bloody woman? We must be away by noon! Three days I’ve known her, and she already has me at the end of my rope!” He clenched his teeth and took a deep breath. “Find her, will you Logen? Find her and bring her back.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What if she doesn’t want to come back?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I don’t know, pick her up and carry her! You can kick her all the way back here as far as I’m concerned!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Easy to say, but Logen didn’t fancy trying it. Still, if it had to be done before they could leave, it was best done now. He sighed, got up from his chair and made for the door.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen pressed himself into the shadows by the wall, watching.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shit,” he whispered to himself. It would have to be now, just as they were about to leave. Ferro was twenty strides away, standing up tall with a deeper than usual scowl on her dark face. There were three men gathered round her. Masked men, all in black. Their sticks were down by their legs, behind their backs, kept half out of sight, but Logen had no doubt about what they had in mind. He could hear one of them talking, hissing through his mask, something about coming quietly. He winced. Coming quietly didn’t sound like Ferro’s style.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He wondered whether he should slip away and tell the others. He couldn’t really say he liked the woman much, not near enough to get his head broken for her. But if he left them to it, three against one, the chances were they’d have knocked her to pieces by the time he got back, however tough she was, and dragged her off to who knew where. He might never get out of this damn city then.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He started judging the distance, thinking about how best to go at them, weighing his chances, but he’d been too long doing nothing, and his mind moved slowly. He was still working on it when Ferro suddenly jumped on one of them, yelling at the top of her voice, knocking him on his back. She gave him a couple of vicious-looking punches in the face before the others caught hold of her and dragged her up.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shit,” hissed Logen. The three of them wrestled, lurching around in the lane, knocking against the walls, grunting and swearing, kicking and punching, a tangle of flailing limbs. It seemed that time had run out for a clever approach. Logen gritted his teeth and charged towards them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The one on the floor had rolled to his feet, shaking the fuzz out of his head while the other two struggled to get a good grip on Ferro. Now he lifted his stick high, arching back, ready to smash her on the skull. Logen let go a roar. The masked face snapped round, surprised-looking.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh?” Then Logen’s shoulder crunched into his ribs, lifting him off his feet and sending him sprawling. Out of the corner of his eye he saw someone swing a stick at him, but he’d got them offguard and there was no real force behind it. He caught it across his arm then pressed in under it and smashed the man right in the mask with his fists, a full-blooded punch with each hand. He reeled back, arms flopping, already falling. Logen grabbed him by two fistfuls of his black coat, hauled him into the air and flung him upsidedown into the wall.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He bounced off with a gurgle and crumpled on the cobbles. Logen spun round, fists clenched, but the last one was lying on his face with Ferro on top of him, one knee jammed into his back, pulling his head up by the hair and smashing his face into the road, shouting meaningless curses all the while.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What did you fucking do?” he shouted, grabbing her under the elbow and dragging her off.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She tore free of his grip and stood there panting, fists bunched up by her sides, blood leaking out of her nose. “Nothing,” she snarled.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen took a cautious step back. “Nothing? What’s this then?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She bit off each word in her ugly accent and spat them at him. “I… don’t… know.” She wiped her bloody mouth with one hand, then froze. Logen glanced over his shoulder. Three more masked men, running at them down the narrow lane.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shit.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Move, pink!” Ferro turned and started running and Logen followed her. What else could he do? He ran. The horrible, breathless running of the hunted, shoulders prickling for a blow in the back, sucking in air in gasps, the slapping footfalls of the men behind echoing around him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">High white buildings flashed past on either side, windows, doors, statues, gardens. People too, shouting as they dived out of the way or flattening themselves against the walls. He had no idea where they were, no idea where they were going. A man stepped out of a doorway right in front of him, a big sheaf of papers in his arms. They crashed together, tumbled to the ground, rolling over and over in the gutter with papers flapping down all around them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He tried to get up but his legs were burning. He couldn’t see! There was a piece of paper across his face. He tore it away, felt someone grab him under the arm and haul him along. “Up, pink!</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Move!” Ferro. She wasn’t even out of breath. Logen’s lungs were bursting as he struggled to keep up with her but she pulled steadily away, head down, feet flying.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She charged through an archway just ahead and Logen laboured after her, boots skidding as he turned the corner. A great shadowy space, timbers reaching up high above, like a strange forest of square beams. Where the hell were they? There was bright light just ahead, open air. He plunged out into it, blinking. Ferro was just beyond him, turning round slowly, breathing hard. They were in the middle of a circle of grass, a little circle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He knew where they were now. The arena where he’d sat among the crowds, watching the sword-game. The empty benches stretched away all round. There were carpenters crawling amongst them, sawing and hammering. They’d already taken some of the benches to pieces near the back and the supports stuck up high into the air alone like giant rib bones. He put his hands on his wobbly knees and bent over, gasping for air, blowing spit out onto the ground.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What… now?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“This way.” Logen straightened up with an effort and wobbled after her, but she was already on her way back. “Not that way!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen saw them. Black masked figures, again. The one at the front was a woman, tall with a shock of red hair sprouting off her head. She padded towards the circle silently on the balls of her feet, waved her arm behind her, pointing the other two out to the sides, trying to get on the flanks, surround him. Logen cast about, looking for a weapon, but there was nothing—just the empty benches and the high white walls beyond. Ferro was backing towards him, not ten feet away, and beyond her there were two more masks, creeping out around the enclosures with sticks in their hands. Five. Five altogether.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shit,” he said.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What the hell is keeping them?” growled Bayaz, pacing the floor. Jezal had never seen the old man annoyed before, and for some reason it made him nervous. Whenever he came close, Jezal wanted to back away. “I’m having a bath, damn it. Could be months before my next one. Months!” Bayaz stalked out of the room and slammed the bathroom door behind him, leaving Jezal alone with the apprentice.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They were probably close enough in age, but they had nothing else in common, so far as Jezal could see, and he stared with unconcealed contempt. A sickly, weaselly, puny, bookish sort. Sulking like that, moping around, it was pathetic. Rude, too. Damn rude. Jezal fumed silently. Just who did he think he was, the arrogant pup? What the hell did he have to be so upset about? It wasn’t him who’d had his life stolen out from under him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Still, if he had to be left alone with one of them, he supposed it could have been worse. It might have been the moron Northman with his fumbling, thick-tongued small-talk. Or that Gurkish witch, staring and staring with her devil-yellow eyes. He shuddered to think of it. People of quality, Bayaz had said. He would have laughed had he not been on the verge of tears.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal cast himself down on the cushions in a high-backed chair, but he found scant comfort there. His friends were on their way to Angland now, and he missed them already. West, Kaspa, Jalenhorm. Even that bastard Brint. On their way to honour, on their way to fame. The campaign would be long finished by the time he returned from whatever pit the old madman was leading him to, if he returned at all. Who knew when the next war would be, the next chance at glory?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">How he wished he was going to fight the Northmen. How he wished he was with Ardee. It seemed like an age since he was happy. His life was awful. Awful. He lay back listlessly in his chair, wondering if things could possibly be any worse.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gurgh,” growled Logen as a stick cracked into his arm, then another into his shoulder, one in his side. He stumbled back, half on his knees, fending them away as best as he could. He could hear Ferro screaming somewhere behind him, fury or pain he couldn’t say, he was too busy taking a battering.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Something smacked across his skull, hard enough to send him reeling away towards the seats. He fell on his face and the front bench hit him in the chest, driving the air from his lungs. There was blood running down his scalp, on his hands, in his mouth. His eyes were watering from a blow to the nose, his knuckles were all skinned and bloody, near as ripped as his clothes were. He lay there, for a moment, gathering whatever strength was left. There was a thick length of timber lying on the ground behind the bench. He grabbed hold of the end of it. It was loose. He dragged it towards him. It felt good in his hand. Heavy.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He sucked in air, summoning one more effort. He moved his arms and legs a little, testing them. Nothing broken—except his nose maybe, but it was hardly the first time. He heard footsteps coming up behind. Slow footsteps, taking their time.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He pushed himself up, slowly, trying to look as though he was in a daze. Then he let go a roar and spun round, swinging the timber over his head. It broke in half across the masked man’s shoulder with a mighty crack, half of it flying up off the turf and clattering away. The man gave a muffled wail and sank down, eyes screwed shut, one hand clutching at his neck, the other hanging useless, stick dropping from his fingers. Logen hefted the short piece of wood left in his hands and clubbed him across the face with it. It snapped his head back and drove him into the turf, mask half torn off, blood bubbling out from underneath.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen’s head exploded with light and he tottered and sagged down on to his knees. Someone had hit him in the back of the head. Hit him hard. He swayed there for a moment trying to stop himself falling on his face, then things came suddenly back into focus. The red-haired woman was standing over him, raising her stick high.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen shoved himself up, flailed into her, fumbled with her arm, half pulling at her, half leaning on her, ears ringing, the world swinging madly. They staggered around, tugging on the stick like two drunkards wrestling over a bottle, back and forth in the circle of grass. He felt her punching him in the side with her other hand. Hard punches, right in the ribs.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Aargh,” he growled, but his head was clearing now, and she was half his weight. He twisted the arm with the stick around behind her back. She punched him again, a knock on the side of his face that brought the stars back for an instant, but then he got hold of her other wrist and pinned that arm as well. He bent her backwards over his knee.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She kicked and twisted, eyes screwed up to furious slits, but Logen had her fast. He freed his right hand from the tangle of limbs, brought his fist up high and mashed it into her stomach. She gave a breathy wheeze and went limp, eyes bulging. He flung her away and she crawled a foot or two, pulled her mask down and started coughing puke onto the grass.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen stumbled and swayed, shook his head, spitting blood and dirt out onto the grass. Aside from the retching woman, there were four black, crumpled shapes stretched out in the circle. One of them was grunting softly as Ferro kicked him over and over. She had blood all over her face, but she was smiling.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I am still alive,” Logen muttered to himself, “I am still…” There were more of them coming through the archway. He swung around, almost falling over. More, four more, from the other side. They were trapped.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Move, pink!” Ferro dashed past him and sprang up onto the first bench, then the second, then the third, springing between them with great strides. Madness. Where was she going to go from there? Red Hair had stopped puking, she was crawling towards her fallen stick. The others were closing in fast, more of them than ever. Ferro was already a quarter of the way back and showing no signs of slowing, bounding from one bench to the next, making the planks rattle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shit.” Logen set off after her. After a dozen benches his legs were burning again. He gave up trying to spring between them and started scrambling however he could. As he flopped over the backs of the benches he could see the masked men behind—following, watching, pointing and calling, spreading out through the seats.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was slowing now. Each bench was a mountain. The nearest mask was only a few rows behind. He scrambled on, higher and higher, bloody hands clutching at the wood, bloody knees scraping across the benches, skull echoing with his own breath, skin prickling with sweat and fear. Air loomed suddenly empty before him. He stopped, gasping, arms waving, teetering on the edge of a dizzying drop.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was close to the high roofs of the buildings behind, but most of the seating near the back had already been taken down, leaving the supports exposed—single looming pillars, narrow beams between them, and a lot of high, empty space. He watched Ferro spring from one soaring upright to another, then run across a wobbling plank, heedless of the plunging space below. She jumped off onto a flat roof at the far end, high above him. It seemed a very long way away.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shit.” Logen teetered out across the nearest beam, arms stretched out wide for balance, feet moving in an old man’s shuffle. His heart was banging like a smith’s hammer on an anvil, his knees were weak and wobbling from the climb. He tried to ignore the scrambling and shouting of the men behind him and look only at the knotted surface of the beam, but he couldn’t look down without seeing the spider’s web of timbers below him, and the tiny flagstones of the square below them. Far below.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He lurched onto a stretch of walkway still intact, clattered up it to the far end. He hauled himself up onto a timber above his head, locked his legs around it and dragged himself along on his arse whispering “I am still alive,” to himself, over and over. The nearest mask had made it to the walkway, was running along it towards him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The beam ended at the top of one of the upright struts. A square of wood a foot or two across. Then there was nothing. Two strides of empty air. Then another square at the top of another dizzying mast, then the plank to the flat roof. Ferro stared at him from the parapet.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Jump!” she screamed. “Jump, you pink bastard!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He jumped. He felt the wind around him. His left foot landed on the square of wood, but there was no stopping. His right foot hit the plank. His ankle twisted, his knee buckled. The dizzy world pitched. His left foot came down, half on the wood, half off. The plank rattled. He was in the empty air, limbs flailing. It seemed like a long time.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ooof!” The parapet crashed into his chest. His arms clawed with it but there was no breath left in him. He began to slide back, ever so slowly, inch by terrible inch. First he could see the roof, then he could see his hands, then he could see nothing but the stones in front of his face. “Help,” he whispered, but no help came.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was a long way down, he knew that. A long, long way, and there was no water to fall into this time. Only hard, flat, fatal stone. He heard a rattling. The mask coming across the plank behind him. He heard someone shouting, but none of it mattered much now. He slipped backwards a little further, hands scrabbling at the crumbling mortar. “Help,” he croaked, but there was no one to help him. Only the masks and Ferro, and none of them seemed like the helping kind.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He heard a clunk and a despairing shriek. Ferro kicking the plank, and the mask falling. The scream fell away, it felt like for a long time, then it was cut off in a distant thud. The mask’s body smashing to pulp against the ground, far below, and Logen knew he was about to join him. You have to be realistic about these things. There would be no washing up on a river bank this time. His fingertips were slipping, slowly, the mortar was starting to come apart. The fighting, the running, the climb, they had all sucked the strength out of him, and now there was nothing left. He wondered what sound he would make as he plunged through the air. “Help,” he mouthed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">And strong fingers closed around his wrist. Dark, dirty fingers. He heard growling, felt his arm being pulled, hard. He groaned. The edge of the parapet came back into view. He saw Ferro now, teeth gritted, eyes squeezed almost shut with effort, veins standing out from her neck, scar livid against her dark face. He clutched at the parapet with his other hand, his chest came up beyond it, he managed to force his knee over.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She hauled him the rest of the way, and he rolled and flopped on his back on the other side, gasping like a landed fish, staring up at the white sky. “I am still alive,” he muttered to himself after a moment, hardly able to believe it. It wouldn’t have been too much of a surprise if Ferro had trodden on his hands and helped him fall.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Her face appeared above him, yellow eyes staring down, teeth bared in a snarl. “You stupid, heavy pink bastard!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She turned away, shaking her head, stalked to a wall and started climbing, hauling herself up fast towards a low-pitched roof above. Logen winced as he watched her. Did she never get tired? His arms were battered, bruised, scratched all over. His legs ached, his nose had started bleeding again. Everything hurt. He turned and looked down. One mask was staring at him from the edge of the benches, twenty strides away. A few more were scurrying around below, looking for some way up. Far below, in the yellow circle of grass, he could see a thin black figure with red hair, pointing around, then up at him, giving orders.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sooner or later they would find a way up. Ferro was perched on the peak of the roof above him, a ragged dark shape against the bright sky. “Stay there if you want,” she barked, then turned and disappeared. Logen groaned as he stood up, groaned as he shuffled to the wall, sighed as he began to search for a handhold.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Where is everyone?” demanded Brother Longfoot. “Where is my illustrious employer? Where is Master Ninefingers? Where is the charming lady, Maljinn?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal looked around. The sickly apprentice was sunk too deep in self-centred gloom to answer. “I don’t know about the other two, but Bayaz is in the bath.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I swear, I never came upon a man more attached to bathing than he. I hope the others will not be long. All is prepared, you know! The ship is ready. The stores are loaded. It is not my way to delay. Indeed it is not! We must catch the tide, or be stuck here until—” The little man paused, staring up at Jezal with a sudden concern. “You seem upset, my young friend. Troubled, indeed. Can I, Brother Longfoot, be of any assistance?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal had half a mind to tell him to mind his own business, but he settled for an irritated, “No, no.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’d wager that there is a woman involved. Would I be right?” Jezal looked up sharply, wondering how the man could have guessed. “Your wife, perhaps?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No! I’m not married! It’s nothing like that. It’s er, well,” he fumbled for the words to describe it, and failed. “It’s nothing like that is all!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah,” said the Navigator, with a knowing grin. “Ah, a forbidden love then, a secret love is it?” Much to his annoyance, Jezal found that he was blushing. “I am right, I see it! There is no fruit so sweet as the one you cannot taste, eh, my young friend? Eh? Eh?” He waggled his eyebrows in what Jezal felt was a most unsavoury fashion.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I wonder what’s keeping those two?” Jezal didn’t care in the least, but anything to change the subject.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Maljinn, and Ninefingers? Hah,” laughed Longfoot, leaning towards him. “Perhaps they’ve become involved, eh, in a secret love like yours? Perhaps they’ve crept off somewhere, to do what comes naturally!” He nudged Jezal in the ribs. “Can you imagine, those two? That’d be something wouldn’t it? Hah!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal grimaced. The hideous Northman he already knew for an animal, and from what little he’d seen of that evil woman she might well be worse. All he could imagine coming naturally to them was violence. The idea was perfectly revolting. He felt soiled just thinking about it.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The roofs seemed to go on forever. Up one, down another. Creeping along the peaks, one slippery foot on either side, edging across ledges, stepping over crumbling bits of wall. Sometimes Logen would look up for a moment, get a dizzying view across the tumbling mass of damp slates, pitted tiles, ancient lead, to the distant wall of the Agriont, sometimes even the city far beyond. It might almost have been peaceful if it wasn’t for Ferro, fast-moving, sure-footed, cursing at him and pulling him on, giving him no time to think about the view, or the nerve-wracking drops they skirted, or the black figures, surely still seeking for them below.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">One of her sleeves had been torn half off some time in the fighting, flapping around her wrist, getting in the way as they climbed. She snarled and ripped it away at the shoulder. Logen smiled to himself as he recalled the efforts Bayaz had gone to in getting her to change her old stinking rags for new clothes. Now she was filthier than ever, shirt sweated through, spotted with blood and caked with grime from the roof-tops. She looked over her shoulder and saw him watching her. “Move, pink,” she hissed at him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You see no colours, right?” She clambered on, ignoring him, swinging around a smoking chimney and slithering across the dirty slates on her belly, sliding down onto a narrow ledge between two roofs. Logen scrambled down behind her. “No colours at all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So?” she threw over her shoulder.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So why do you call me pink?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She looked round. “Are you pink?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen peered at his forearms. Aside from the mottled bruises, red scratches, blue veins, they were sort of pink, it had to be said. He frowned.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Thought so.” She scurried away between the roofs, right to the end of the building, and peered down. Logen followed her, leaned out gingerly over the edge. A couple of people were moving around in the lane below. Far below, and there was no way down. They’d have to go back the way they came. Ferro had already moved away behind him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Wind flicked at the side of Logen’s face. Ferro’s foot slapped against the edge of the roof, and then she was in the air. His jaw hung open as he watched her fly away, back arched, arms and legs flailing. She landed on a flat roof, grey lead streaked with green moss, rolled once then came up smoothly to her feet.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen licked his lips, pointed at his chest. She nodded. The flat roof was ten feet below, but there might have been twenty feet of empty air between him and it, and it was a long way down. He backed away slowly, giving himself a good run-up. He sucked in a couple of deep breaths, closed his eyes for a moment.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It would be perfect, in a way, if he fell. No songs, no stories. Just a bloody smear on a road somewhere. He started running. His feet thumped on the stone. The air whistled in his mouth, plucked at his torn clothes. The flat roof came flying up towards him. He landed with a shuddering impact, rolled once just as Ferro had done, stood up beside her. He was still alive.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hah!” he shouted. “What d’you think of that?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a creaking sound, then a cracking, then the roof gave way under Logen’s feet. He grabbed despairingly at Ferro as he fell and she slid through after him, helpless. He tumbled in the air for a sickening moment, wailing, hands clutching at nothing. He crashed down on his back.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen coughed on choking dust, shook his head, shifted painfully. He was in a room, inky dark after the brightness outside. Dust was filtering down through the light from the ragged hole in the roof above. There was something soft under him. A bed. It had half collapsed, leaning at an angle, blankets covered in broken plaster. There was something across his legs. Ferro. He snorted a gurgling laugh to himself. In bed with a woman again, at last. Unfortunately it wasn’t quite what he’d been hoping for.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Stupid fucking pink!” she snarled, scrabbling off him and over to the door, bits of wood and plaster sliding off her dusty back. She hauled on the doorknob. “Locked! It’s—” Logen crashed past her, ripping the door off its hinges and sprawling out into the corridor beyond.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro sprang over him. “Up, pink, up!” A handy-looking length of wood had split from the edge of the door, a couple of nails sticking out of the end. Logen snatched it up in his hand. He struggled to his feet, stumbled down the corridor a few paces, came to a junction. A shadowy hallway stretched away to either side. Small windows cast sharp pools of light on the dark matting.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">No way to tell which way Ferro had gone. He turned right, towards a flight of stairs.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a figure moving carefully down the dim corridor towards him. Long and thin like a black spider in the darkness, balanced on the balls of its feet. A chink of light shone on bright red hair.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You again,” said Logen, weighing the length of wood in his hand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s right. Me.” There was a jingling sound, a flash of metal in the dark. Logen felt the piece of wood ripped out of his fingers and he saw it fly over the woman’s shoulder and clatter away down the corridor. Unarmed again, but she didn’t give him long to worry about it. There was something in her hand, something like a knife, and she threw it at him. He ducked out of the way and it hissed past his ear, then she jerked her other arm and something slashed him across the face, just under his eye. He lurched back against the wall, trying to understand what kind of magic he was facing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was like a metal cross, the thing in her hand, three curved blades, one with a hook on the end. A chain looped from a ring on the handle and disappeared up her sleeve.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The knife-thing darted out, missed Logen’s face by an inch as he bobbed away, struck a shower of sparks as it ripped back along the wall and slapped smoothly back into her hand. She let it drop, swinging gently from its chain, rattling against the floor, jumping and dancing towards him as she edged forward. She jerked her wrist and the thing shot out at Logen again, slashed across his chest as he tried to get away, spattering drops of blood against the wall.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He dived at her but his outspread arms caught nothing. There was a rattle and he felt his foot dragged from under him, his ankle snapped round painfully, caught by the chain as she ducked by. He sprawled out on his face, started to push himself up. The chain snaked under his neck. He just got his hand behind it before it snapped taut. The woman was on top of him, he could feel her knee pressing into his back, could hear her breath hissing through her mask as she pulled, the chain growing tighter and tighter, cutting into the palm of his hand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen grunted, scrabbling to his knees, lumbering unsteadily to his feet. The woman was still on his back, all her weight bearing down on him, pulling at the chain as hard as she could. Logen flailed around with his free hand but he couldn’t get at her, couldn’t throw her off—she was like a barnacle stuck fast to him. He could hardly breathe now. He tottered forward a few steps, then dropped over backwards.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Uurgh,” whispered the woman in his ear as his weight crushed her into the floor. The chain went slack enough for Logen to drag it clear and slither out from under it. Free. He rolled over and grabbed the woman’s neck with his left hand, started squeezing. She kneed at him, dug at him with her fists, but his weight was across her and the blows were weak. They snarled and gasped and croaked at each other, animal sounds, faces only inches apart. A couple of spots of blood dripped from the cut on his cheek and pattered on her mask. Her hand came up and started fumbling with his face, pushing his head back. Her finger forced its way up his nose.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Aargh!” he screamed. Pain stabbed up into his head. He let go of her and staggered up, one hand clasped to his face. She scrambled away, coughing, landed a kick in his ribs that bent him over, but he still had a grip on the chain and he yanked on it with all his weight. Her arm snapped out and she yelped and flew straight into him, his knee sinking into her side, crushing the breath out of her. Logen grabbed hold of the back of her shirt, half lifted her off the floor and flung her down the stairs.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She rolled and flopped and bounced her way down, slid to a stop on her side near the bottom. Logen was half-tempted to follow her down and finish the job, but he had no time. There’d be more where she came from. He turned and hobbled back the other way, cursing his twisted ankle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sounds crept up on him from all around, echoing down the corridor from who knew where. Distant rattling and banging, shouts and cries. He stared into darkness, limping, running with sweat, one hand on the wall to steady himself. He leaned round a corner, trying to see if it was clear. He felt something cold across his neck. A knife.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Still alive?” whispered a voice in his ear. “You don’t die easy, eh, pink?” Ferro. He slowly pushed her arm away.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Where d’you get the knife?” He wished he had one.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He gave it me.” There was a crumpled shape in the shadows by the wall, the matting all round soaked with dark blood. “This way.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro crept off down the corridor, keeping low in the darkness. He could still hear the sounds, beneath them, beside them, all around them. They crept down a flight of stairs, out into a dim hallway panelled with dark wood. Ferro ducked from shadow to shadow, moving fast. Logen could do no more than limp after her, dragging his leg, trying not to squeal with pain whenever he put his weight on it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There! It’s them!” Figures in the dim corridor behind. He turned to run, but Ferro held her arm out. There were more, coming the other way. There was a big door on his left, standing open a crack.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“In here!” Logen shoved his way through and Ferro darted in after him. There was a heavy piece of furniture beside it, a big cupboard thing with shelves on top, covered in plates. Logen grabbed hold of one end and dragged it across in front of the doors, a couple of the plates dropping off and smashing on the floor. He pressed his back against it. That should hold them for a moment, at least.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A big room with a high vaulted ceiling. Two huge windows took up most of one wood-panelled wall, a big stone fireplace facing them. A long table stood between, ten chairs on either side, set for eating with cutlery and candlesticks. A big dining room, and there was only one way in. Or out.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen heard muffled shouting beyond the door. The big cupboard wobbled against his back. Another plate clattered from its shelf, bounced off his shoulder and smashed on the stone flags, scattering fragments across the floor.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Nice fucking plan,” snarled Ferro. Logen’s feet slid as he strained to hold the teetering cupboard up. She dashed over to the nearest window, fumbled at the metal frames round the little panes, prising with her fingernails, but there was no way out.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen’s eye caught on something. An old greatsword, mounted over the fireplace as an ornament. A weapon. He gave the cupboard one last shove then hurried over to it, seized hold of the long hilt in both hands and ripped it from its bracket. It was blunt as a plough, the heavy blade spotted with rust, but still solid. A blow from it might not cut a man in half, but it would knock him down alright. He turned just in time to see the cupboard tipping over, dropping shattering crockery all over the stone floor.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Black figures spilled into the room, masked figures. The one at the front had an evil-looking axe, the next a short-bladed sword. The one behind him was dark-skinned, with gold rings through his ears. He had a long, curved dagger in either hand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Those weapons were not for knocking a man on the head with, not unless they meant to knock his brains right out. Seemed that they’d given up on taking prisoners. Killing weapons, meant to kill. Well, so much the better, Logen told himself. If you say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, and one thing only, say he’s a killer. He eyed those black-masked men, clambering over the fallen cupboard, spreading out cautiously around the far wall. He glanced over at Ferro, lips curled back, knife in her hand, yellow eyes sparkling. He fingered the grip of his stolen sword—heavy and brutal. Just the tool for the job, for once.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He plunged at the nearest mask, yelling at the top of his voice, swinging the sword over his head. The man tried to duck away but the tip of the blade caught him on the shoulder and knocked him reeling. Another one jumped in behind him, chopping with his axe, sending Logen stumbling away, gasping as his weight went onto his bad ankle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He flailed around with the big sword, but there were too many. One scrambled over the table, got between him and Ferro. Something hit him in the back and he stumbled, spun, slipped, lashed out with the sword and hit something soft. Somebody screamed, but by then the one with the axe was coming for him again. Everything was a mess of masks and iron, clashing, scraping weapons, curses and cries, ragged breathing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen swung the sword but he was so tired, so hurt, so aching. The sword was heavy, and getting heavier all the time. The mask weaved out of the way and the rusty blade clanged into the wall, knocking a great chunk out of the wooden panelling and biting into the plaster behind, the shock nearly jarring it out of his hands.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ooof,” he breathed as the man kneed him in the stomach. Something hit him in the leg and he nearly fell. He could hear somebody yelling behind, but it seemed far away. His chest was hurting, his mouth was sour. There was blood on him. All over him. He could hardly breathe. The mask stepped forward, and again, smiling, smelling victory. Logen lurched back towards the fireplace, his foot slipping, falling down on one knee.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">All things come to an end.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He couldn’t lift the old sword any more. There was no strength left. Nothing. The room was growing blurry.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">All things come to an end, but some only lie still, forgotten…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a cold feeling in Logen’s stomach, a feeling he hadn’t felt for a long time. “No,” he whispered. “I’m free of you.” But it was too late. Too late…</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">…there was blood on him, but that was good. There was always blood. But he was kneeling, and that was wrong. The Bloody-Nine kneels to no man. His fingers sought out the cracks between the stones of the fireplace, prising between them like old tree roots, pulling him up. His leg hurt and he smiled. Pain was the fuel that made the fires burn. Something moved in front of him. Masked men. Enemies.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Corpses, then.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re hurt, Northman!” The eyes of the closest one sparkled above his mask, the shining blade of his axe danced in the air. “Want to give up yet?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hurt?” The Bloody-Nine threw back his head and laughed. “I’ll fucking show you hurt!” He tumbled forward, flowed beneath the axe, slippery as fishes in the river, swinging the heavy blade in a great low circle. It crunched into the man’s knee and cracked it back the wrong way, scythed on into his other leg and ripped it out from under him. He gave a muffled scream as he spun onto the stones, turning round and round in the air, shattered legs flopping.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Something dug into the Bloody-Nine’s back, but there was no pain. It was a sign. A message in a secret tongue, that only he could understand. It told him where the next dead man was standing. He reeled around and the sword followed him in a furious, beautiful, irresistible arc. It crunched into someone’s guts, folded him in half, snatched him off his feet and flung him through the air. He bounced from the wall beside the fireplace and crumpled on the floor in a shower of broken plaster.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A knife whirled, hissing, stuck deep into the Bloody-Nine’s shoulder with a damp thud. The black one, with the rings through his ears. He had thrown it. He was on the other side of the table, smiling, pleased with his throw. A terrible mistake. The Bloody-Nine came for him. Another knife flashed past, clattered against the wall. He sprang over the table and the sword followed behind.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The dark man dodged the first great swing, and the second. Fast and tricky clever, but not clever enough. The third blow bit him in the side. A glancing bite. Just a nibble. It only smashed his ribs and knocked him screaming to his knees. The last one was better, a circle of flesh and iron that carved into his mouth and ripped his head half off, showering blood across the walls. The Bloody-Nine plucked the knife from his shoulder and tossed it to the floor. Blood ran from the wound, soaked through his shirt and made a great, lovely, warm red stain.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He dropped and faded away, leaves falling from the tree, rolling across the ground. A man lunged past, slashing at the air where he had stood with a short-bladed sword. Before he could turn, the Bloody-Nine was on him, left hand snaking round his fists. He struggled and strained, but it was useless. The Bloody-Nine’s grip was strong as the roots of mountains, relentless as the tide. “They send such as you to fight me?” He flung the man back against the wall and squeezed, crushing his hands around the grip of his weapon, turning the short blade until it was pointing at his chest. “A fucking insult!” he roared, spitting him on his own sword.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The man screamed, and screamed behind his mask, and the Bloody-Nine laughed, and twisted the blade. Logen might have pitied him, but Logen was far away and the Bloody-Nine had no more pity in him than the winter. Less even. He stabbed, and cut, and cut, and smiled, and the screams bubbled and died, and he let the corpse drop to the cold stones. His fingers were slick with blood and he wiped it on his clothes, on his arms, on his face—just as it should be.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The one by the fireplace was sitting, hanging limp, head back, eyes like wet stones, staring at the ceiling. Part of the earth now. The Bloody-Nine smashed his face open with the sword just to make sure. Best to leave no doubts. The one who’d had the axe was crawling for the door, legs twisted out and dragging over the stones behind him, gasping and whimpering all the way.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Quiet now.” The heavy blade crunched into the back of the man’s skull and sprayed his blood across the stones.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“More,” he whispered, and the room turned around him as he sought out the next kill. “More!” he bellowed, and he laughed, and the walls laughed, and the corpses laughed with him. “Where’s the rest of you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He saw a dark-skinned woman, with a bleeding cut on her face and a knife in her hand. She didn’t look like the others, but she would do just as well. He smiled, crept forward, raising the sword in both hands. She stepped away, watching him, keeping the table between them, hard yellow eyes like the wolf. A tiny voice seemed to tell him that she was on his side. Shame.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Northerner, eh?” asked a massive shape in the doorway.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Aye, who’s asking?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Stone-Splitter.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was big this one, very big, and tough, and savage. You could see it on him as he shoved the cupboard away with his huge boot and crunched forward through the broken plates. It meant less than nothing to the Bloody-Nine though—he was made to break such men. Tul Duru Thunderhead had been bigger. Rudd Threetrees had been tougher. Black Dow had been twice as savage. The Bloody-Nine had broken them, and plenty more besides. The bigger, the tougher, the more savage he was, so much the worse would be his breaking.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Stone-Shitter?” laughed the Bloody-Nine. “So fuckin’ what? Next to die is what y’are, and nothing more!” He held his left hand up, spattered with red blood, three fingers spread out wide, grinning through the gap where the middle one used to be, a long time ago. “They call me the Bloody-Nine.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Dah!” The Stone-Splitter ripped off his mask and threw it on the floor. “Liar! There’s plenty o’ men in the north have lost a finger. They ain’t all Ninefingers!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No. Only me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">That great face twisted up with rage. “You fucking liar! You think to scare the Stone-Splitter with a name that’s not your own? I’ll carve a new arse in you, maggot! I’ll put the bloody cross on you! I’ll put you back in the mud you coward fucking liar!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Kill me?” The Bloody-Nine laughed louder than ever. “I do the killing, fool!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The talk was done. Stone-Splitter came at him with axe in one hand and mace in the other, great heavy weapons, though he used them quick enough. The mace swung across, smashed a great hole through the glass in one of the windows. The axe came down, split one timber of the table in half, made the plates jump in the air, the candlesticks topple. The Bloody-Nine twitched away, frog hopping, waiting for his time.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The mace missed his shoulder by an inch as he rolled across the table, cracked one of the big flat stones on the floor, split it down the middle, chips flying through the air. Stone-Splitter roared, swinging his weapons, smashing a chair in half, knocking a chunk of stone out of the fireplace, chopping a great gash in the wall. His axe stuck fast in the wood for a moment and the Bloody-Nine’s sword flashed over, broke the haft into splintered halves, leaving the Stone-Splitter with a broken stick in his paw. He flung it away and hefted the mace, came on even harder, swinging it round with furious bellows.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It sailed over and the Bloody-Nine’s sword caught it just below the head, ripped it out of the big hand. It twisted through the air and clattered into the corner, but the Stone-Splitter pressed forward, spreading his great hands out wide. Too close to use the big sword now. Stone-Splitter smiled as his huge arms closed around the Bloody-Nine, folding him tight, holding him fast. “Got yer!” he shouted, squeezing him in a great hug.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">An awful mistake. Better to embrace the burning fire.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Crack!</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Bloody-Nine’s forehead smashed into his mouth. He felt the Stone-Splitter’s grip slacken a little and he wriggled his shoulders, making room, wriggling, wriggling, mole in his burrow. He swung his head back as far as it would go. Billy-goat charges. The second head-butt smashed the Stone-Splitter’s flat nose open. He grunted and the big arms released a little more. The third cracked his cheekbone. The arms fell away. The fourth broke his heavy jaw. Now it was the Bloody-Nine holding him up, smiling as he mashed his forehead into the shattered face. Woodpecker pecking, tap, tap, tap. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. There was a satisfying rhythm to the crunching of the face bones. Nine, and he let the Stone-Splitter fall. He sagged sideways and crumpled onto the floor, blood spilling from his ruined face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“How’s that for yer?” laughed the Bloody-Nine, wiping blood out of his eyes and giving the Stone-Splitter’s lifeless body a couple of kicks. The room spun around him, swam around him, laughing, laughing. “How’s that… fuck…” He stumbled, blinked, sleepy, campfire guttering. “No… not yet…” He dropped to his knees. Not yet. There was more to do, always more. “Not yet,” he snarled, but his time was up…</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">…Logen screamed. He fell down. Pain, everywhere. His legs, his shoulder, his head. He wailed until the blood caught in his throat, then he coughed and gasped and rolled around, scrabbling at the floor. The world was a blurry smear. He gurgled up blood and drooled it out, long enough to start wailing again.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A hand clamped over his mouth. “Stop your damn crying, pink! Now, you hear me?” A voice, whispering urgent in his ear. Strange, hard voice. “Stop your crying or I leave you, understand? One chance!” The hand came away. Air came out between his gritted teeth in a high pitched, keening moan, but not too loud.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A hand clamped round his wrist, dragged his arm up. He gasped as his shoulder stretched out, was dragged over something hard. Torture. “Up, bastard, I can’t carry you! Up, now! One chance, understand?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was lifted slowly, he tried to push with his legs. The breath whistled and clicked in his throat, but he could do it. Left foot, right foot. Easy. His knee buckled, pain stabbed up his leg. He screamed again and fell, grovelled on the floor. Best to lie still. His eyes closed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Something slapped him hard in the face, and again. He grunted. Something slid under his armpit, started to pull him up.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Up, pink! Up, or I leave you. One chance, you hear?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Breath in, breath out. Left foot, right foot.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Longfoot fussed and worried, first tapping his fingers on the arm of his chair, then counting on them, shaking his head and moaning about tides. Jezal stayed silent, hoping against hope that the two savages might have drowned in the moat, and that the whole venture might therefore come to nothing. There would still be plenty of time to make it to Angland. Perhaps all was not lost…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He heard the door open behind him, and his dreams were punctured. Misery swaddled him once again, but it was soon replaced by horrified surprise as he turned around.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Two ragged shapes stood in the doorway, covered in blood and filth. Devils, surely, stepped out from some gate to hell. The Gurkish woman was cursing as she lurched into the room. Ninefingers had one arm across her shoulders, the other swinging loose, blood dripping from his fingertips, head drooping.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They wobbled together for a step or two, then the Northman’s stumbling foot caught on a chair leg and they tumbled onto the floor. The woman snarled and shrugged off his limp arm, shoved him away and scrambled up to her feet. Ninefingers rolled over slowly, groaning, and a deep gash in his shoulder yawned open, oozing blood across the carpet. It was red in there, like fresh meat in a butcher’s shop. Jezal swallowed, horrified and fascinated at once.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“God’s breath!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They came for us.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who came?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A woman sidled cautiously around the door frame, red-haired, all in black, wearing a mask. A Practical, Jezal’s numb brain was saying, but he could not understand why she was so bruised, or walking with such a limp. Another edged through behind her, a man, armed with a heavy sword.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re coming with us,” said the woman.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Make me!” Maljinn spat at her. Jezal was shocked to see she had produced a knife from somewhere, and a bloody one at that. She should not be armed! Not here!</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He realised, stupidly, that he was wearing a sword. Of course he was. He fumbled with the hilt and drew it, with the vague intention of knocking the Gurkish devil on the back of the head with the flat before she could do any more damage. If the Inquisition wanted her they could damn well have her, and the rest of them too. Unfortunately, the Practicals got the wrong idea.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Drop it,” hissed the red-haired woman, glaring at him through narrow eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I will not!” said Jezal, tremendously offended that she might think he was on the side of these villains.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Erm…” said Quai.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Aaargh,” groaned Ninefingers, clutching up a bloody handful of carpet and dragging it towards him, making the table lurch across the floor.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A third Practical crept through the door, around the red-haired woman, a heavy mace in his gloved fist. An unpleasant-looking weapon. Jezal could not help picturing the effect it might have on his skull, if swung in anger. He fingered the hilt of his sword uncertainly, feeling in terrible need of someone to tell him what to do.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Coming with us,” said the woman again, as her two friends advanced slowly into the room.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh dear,” murmured Longfoot, taking cover behind the table.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Then the door to the bathroom banged against the wall. Bayaz stood there, entirely naked, dripping with soapy water. His slow gaze took in first Ferro, scowling with her knife out, then Longfoot hiding behind the table, Jezal with sword drawn, Quai standing with his mouth open, Ninefingers sprawled out in a bloody ruin, and finally the three black masked figures, weapons at the ready.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a pregnant pause.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What the fuck is this?” he roared, striding into the centre of the room, water dripping from his beard, down through the grizzled white hairs on his chest, off his slapping fruits. It was a strange sight to see. A naked old man confronting three armed Practicals of the Inquisition. Ridiculous, and yet no one was laughing. There was something strangely terrifying about him, even without his clothes and running with wet. It was the Practicals who shifted backwards, confused, scared even.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re coming with us,” the woman repeated, though a certain doubt seemed to have entered her voice. One of her companions stepped warily toward Bayaz.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal felt a strange sensation in his stomach. A tugging, a sucking, an empty, sick feeling. It was like being back on the bridge, in the shadow of the Maker’s House. Only worse. The wizard’s face had turned terribly hard. “My patience is at an end.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Like a bottle dropped from a great height, the nearest Practical burst apart. There was no thunderclap, only a gentle squelching. One moment he was moving toward the old man, sword raised, entirely whole. The next he was a thousand fragments. Some unknown part of him thudded wetly against the plaster next to Jezal’s head. His sword dropped and rattled on the boards.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You were saying?” growled the First of the Magi.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal’s knees trembled. His mouth gaped. He felt faint, and queasy, and awfully hollow inside. There were spots of blood across his face, but he dared not move to wipe them off. He stared at the naked old man, unable to believe his eyes. It seemed that he had watched a well-meaning old buffoon change in an instant into a brutal murderer, and without the slightest grain of hesitation.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The red-haired woman stood there a moment, spattered with blood and flecks of meat and bone, eyes wide as two dinner plates, then started to shuffle slowly backwards towards the door. The other one followed her, almost tripping over Ninefingers’ foot in his haste to get away. Everyone else stayed motionless as statues. Jezal heard quick footsteps in the corridor outside as the two Practicals ran for their lives. He almost envied them. They, it seemed, would escape. He was trapped in this nightmare.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We must leave, now!” barked Bayaz, wincing as if he was in pain, “just as soon as I have my trousers on. Help him, Longfoot!” he shouted over his shoulder. For once, the Navigator was lost for words. He blinked, then got up from behind the table and bent down over the unconscious Northman, ripped off a strip of his tattered shirt to use as a bandage. He paused, frowning, as though unsure where to begin.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal swallowed. His sword was still in his hand, but he seemed to lack the strength to put it away. Bits of the unfortunate Practical were scattered around the room, stuck to the walls, the ceiling, the people. Jezal had never seen a man die before, let alone in so hideous and unnatural a fashion. He supposed he should have been horrified, but instead he felt only an overpowering sense of relief. His worries seemed now rather petty things.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He, at least, was still alive.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_47"></div></div></body>

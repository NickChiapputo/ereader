<div id="filepos621480" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> The King’s Justice</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">As soon as he reached the Square of Marshals, Jezal realised there was something wrong. It was never half this busy for a meeting of the Open Council. He glanced over the knots of finely dressed people as he hurried by, slightly late and out of breath from his long training session: voices were hushed, faces tense and expectant.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He shouldered his way through the crowd to the Lord’s Round, glancing suspiciously up at the guards flanking the inlaid doors. They at least seemed the same as ever, their heavy visors giving nothing away. He crossed the ante-chamber, vivid tapestries flapping slightly in the draught, slipped through the inner doors and passed into the vast, cool space beyond. His footsteps made tapping echoes in the gilded dome as he hurried down the aisle towards the high table. Jalenhorm was standing beneath one of the tall windows, face splashed with coloured light from the stained glass, frowning at a bench with a metal rail along its base which had been placed to one side of the floor.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What’s going on?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Haven’t you heard?” Jalenhorm’s voice was whispery with excitement. “Hoffs let it be known there’ll be some great matter to discuss.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What is it? Angland? The Northmen?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The big man shook his head. “Don’t know, but we’ll soon see.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal frowned. “I don’t like surprises.” His eye came to rest on the mysterious bench. “What’s that for?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">At that moment the great doors were swung open and a stream of councillors began to flood down the aisle. The usual mixture, Jezal supposed, if a little more purposeful. The younger sons, the paid representatives… he caught his breath. There was a tall man at the front, richly dressed even in this august company, with a weighty golden chain across his shoulders and a weighty frown across his face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Lord Brock himself,” whispered Jezal.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And there’s Lord Isher.” Jalenhorm nodded at a sedate old man just behind Brock, “and Heugen, and Barezin. It’s something big. It has to be.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal took a deep breath as four of the Union’s most powerful noblemen arranged themselves on the front row. He had never seen the Open Council half so well attended. On the councillors’ half-circle of benches there was barely an empty seat. High above them, the public gallery was an unbroken ring of nervous faces.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Now Hoff blustered through the doors and down the aisle, and he was not alone. On his right a tall man flowed along, slender and proud-looking with a long, spotless white coat and a shock of white hair. Arch Lector Sult. On his left walked another man, leaning heavily on a stick, slightly bent in a robe of black and gold with a long grey beard. High Justice Marovia. Jezal could hardly believe his eyes. Three members of the Closed Council, here.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jalenhorm hurried to take his place as the clerks deposited their burdens of ledgers and papers on the polished tabletop. The Lord Chamberlain threw himself down in their midst and immediately called for wine. The head of his Majesty’s Inquisition swept into a high chair on one side of him, smiling faintly to himself. High Justice Marovia lowered himself slowly into another, frowning all the while. The volume of the anxious whispering in the hall rose a step, the faces of the great magnates on the front row were grim and suspicious. The Announcer took his place before the table, not the usual brightly dressed imbecile, but a dark, bearded man with a barrel chest. He lifted his staff high, then beat it against the tiles, fit to wake the dead.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I call this meeting of the Open Council of the Union to order!” he bellowed. The hubbub gradually died away.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There is but one matter for discussion this morning,” said the Lord Chamberlain, peering sternly at the house from beneath his heavy brows, “a matter of the King’s Justice.” There were scattered mutterings. “A matter concerning the royal licence for trade in the city of Westport.” The noise increased: angry whispers, uncomfortable shufflings of noble arses on their benches, the familiar scratching of quills on the great ledgers. Jezal saw Lord Brock’s brows draw together, the corners of Lord Heugen’s mouth turn down. They did not seem to like the taste of this. The Lord Chamberlain sniffed and took a swig of wine, waiting for the muttering to die away. “I am not best qualified to speak on this matter, however—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No indeed!” snapped Lord Isher sharply, shifting in his seat on the front row with a scowl.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Hoff fixed the old man with his eye. “So I call on a man who is! My colleague from the Closed Council, Arch Lector Sult.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Open Council recognises Arch Lector Sult!” thundered the Announcer, as the head of the Inquisition made his graceful way down the steps of the dais and onto the tiled floor, smiling pleasantly at the angry faces turned towards him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“My Lords,” he began, in a slow, musical voice, ushering his words out into space with smooth movements of his hands, “for the past seven years, ever since our glorious victory in the war with Gurkhul, an exclusive royal licence for trade in the city of Westport has been in the hands of the honourable Guild of Mercers.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And a fine job they’ve done of it!” shouted Lord Heugen.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They won us that war!” growled Barezin, pounding the bench beside him with a meaty fist.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A fine job!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Fine!” came the cries.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector nodded as he waited for the noise to fade. “Indeed they have,” he said, pacing across the tiles like a dancer, his words scratching their way across the pages of the books. “I would be the last to deny it. A fine job.” He spun suddenly around, the tails of his white coat snapping, his face twisted into a brutal snarl. “A fine job of dodging the Kings taxes!” he screamed. There was a collective gasp.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A fine job of slighting the King’s law!” Another gasp, louder. “A fine job of high treason!” There was a storm of protest, of fists shaken in the air and papers thrown to the floor. Livid faces stared down from the public gallery, florid ones ranted and bellowed from the benches before the high table. Jezal stared about him, unsure if he could have heard correctly.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“How dare you, Sult!” Lord Brock roared at the Arch Lector as he swished back up the steps of the dais, a faint smile clinging to his lips.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We demand proof!” bellowed Lord Heugen. “We demand justice!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The King’s Justice!” came cries from the back.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You must supply us with proof!” shouted Isher, as the noise began to fade.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector twitched out his white gown, the fine material billowing around him as he swung himself smoothly back into his chair. “Oh but that is our intention, Lord Isher!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The heavy bolt of a small side door was flung back with an echoing bang. There was a rustling as Lords and proxies twisted round, stood up, squinted over to see what was happening. People in the public gallery peered out over the parapet, leaning dangerously far in their eagerness to see. The hall fell quiet. Jezal swallowed. There was a scraping, tapping, clinking sound beyond the doorway, then a strange and sinister procession emerged from the darkness.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sand dan Glokta came first, limping as always and leaning heavily on his cane, but with his head held high and a twisted, toothless grin on his hollow face. Three men shuffled behind him, chained together by their hands and bare feet, clinking and rattling their way towards the high table. Their heads were shaved bare and they were dressed in brown sackcloth. The clothing of the penitent. Confessed traitors.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The first of the prisoners was licking his lips, eyes darting here and there, pale with terror. The second, shorter and thicker-set, was stumbling, dragging his left leg behind him, hunched over with his mouth hanging open. As Jezal watched, a thin line of pink drool dangled from his lip and spattered on the tiles. The third man, painfully thin and with huge dark rings round his eyes, stared slowly around, blinking, eyes wide but apparently taking nothing in. Jezal recognised the man behind the three prisoners straight away: the big albino from that night in the street. Jezal rocked his weight from one foot to the other, feeling suddenly cold and uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The purpose of the bench was now made clear. The three prisoners slumped down on it, the albino knelt and snapped their manacles shut around the rail along its base. The chamber was entirely silent. Every eye was fixed on the crippled Inquisitor, and his three prisoners.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Our investigation began some months ago,” said Arch Lector Sult, immensely smug at having the assembly so completely under his control. “A simple matter of some irregular accounting, I won’t bore you with the details.” He smiled at Brock, at Isher, at Barezin. “I know you all are very busy men. Who could have thought then, that such a little matter would lead us here? Who would suppose that the roots of treason could run so very deep?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Indeed,” said the Lord Chamberlain impatiently, looking up from his goblet. “Inquisitor Glokta, the floor is yours.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Announcer struck his staff on the tiles. “The Open Council of the Union recognises Sand dan Glokta, Inquisitor Exempt!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The cripple waited politely for the scratching of the clerk’s quills to finish, leaning on his cane in the centre of the floor, seemingly unmoved by the importance of the occasion. “Rise and face the Open Council,” he said, turning to the first of his prisoners.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The terrified man sprang up, his chains rattling, licking his pale lips, goggling at the faces of the Lords in the front row. “Your name?” demanded Glokta.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Salem Rews.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal felt a catch in his throat. Salem Rews? He knew the man! His father had had dealings with him in the past, at one time he had been a regular visitor to their estate! Jezal studied the terrified, shaven-headed traitor with increasing horror. He cast his mind back to the plump, well-dressed merchant, always ready with a joke. It was him, no doubt. Their eyes met for an instant and Jezal looked anxiously away. His father had talked with that man in their hallway! Had shaken hands with him! Accusations of treason are like illnesses—you can catch them just by being in the same room! His eyes were drawn inevitably back to that unfamiliar, yet horribly familiar face. How dare he be a traitor, the bastard?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You are a member of the honourable Guild of Mercers?” continued Glokta, putting a sneering accent into the word “honourable”.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I was,” mumbled Rews.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What was your role within the Guild?” The shaven-headed Mercer stared desperately about him. “Your role?” demanded Glokta, his voice taking on a hard edge.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I conspired to defraud the King!” cried the merchant, wringing his hands. A wave of shock ran round the hall. Jezal swallowed sour spit. He saw Sult smirking across at High Justice Marovia. The old man’s face was stony blank, but his fists were clenched tight on the table before him. “I committed treason! For money! I smuggled, and I bribed, and I lied… we were all at it!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“All at it!” Glokta leered round at the assembly. “And if any of you should doubt it, we have ledgers, and we have documents, and we have numbers. There is a room in the House of Questions stuffed with them. A room full of secrets, and guilt, and lies.” He slowly shook his head. “Sorry reading, I can tell you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I had to do it!” screamed Rews. “They made me! I had no choice!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The crippled Inquisitor frowned at his audience. “Of course they made you. We realise you were but a single brick in this house of infamy. An attempt was made on your life recently, was it not?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They tried to kill me!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who tried?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It was this man!” wailed Rews, voice cracking, pointing a trembling finger at the prisoner next to him, pulling away as far as the chains that linked them would allow. “It was him! Him!” The manacles rattled as he waved his arm, spit flying from his mouth. There was another surge of angry voices, louder this time. Jezal watched the head of the middle prisoner sag and he slumped sideways, but the hulking albino grabbed him and hauled him back upright.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Wake up, Master Carpi!” shouted Glokta. The lolling head came slowly up. An unfamiliar face, strangely swollen and badly pocked with acne-scars. Jezal noticed with disgust that his four front teeth were missing. Just like Glokta’s.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You are from Talins, yes, in Styria?” The man nodded slowly, stupidly, like someone half asleep. “You are paid to kill people, yes?” He nodded again. And you were hired to murder ten of his Majesty’s subjects, among them this confessed traitor, Salem Rews?” A trickle of blood ran slowly out from the man’s nose and his eyes started to roll back in his head. The albino shook him by the shoulder and he came round, nodding groggily. “What became of the other nine?” Silence. “You killed them, did you not?” Another nod, a strange clicking sound coming from the prisoner’s throat.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta frowned slowly around the rapt faces of the Council. “Villem dan Robb, customs official, throat cut ear to ear.” He slid a finger across his neck and a woman in the gallery squealed. “Solimo Scandi, Mercer, stabbed in the back four times.” He thrust up four fingers, then pressed them to his stomach as though sickened. “The bloody list goes on. All murdered, for nothing but a bigger profit. Who hired you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Him,” croaked the killer, turning his swollen face to look at the gaunt man with the glassy eyes, slumped on the bench next to him, heedless of his surroundings. Glokta limped over, cane tapping on the tiles.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What is your name?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The prisoner’s head snapped up, his eyes focusing on the twisted face of the Inquisitor above him. “Gofred Hornlach!” he answered instantly, voice shrill.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You are a senior member of the Guild of Mercers?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes!” he barked, blinking mindlessly up at Glokta.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“One of Magister Kault’s deputies, in fact?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Have you conspired with other Mercers to defraud his Majesty the King? Did you hire an assassin to murder ten of his Majesty’s subjects?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes! Yes!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Why?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We were worried they would tell what they knew… tell what they knew… tell…” Hornlach’s empty eyes stared off towards one of the coloured windows. His mouth slowly stopped moving.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Tell what they knew?” prompted the Inquisitor.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“About the treasonous activities of the Guild!” the Mercer blurted, “about our treasons! About the activities of the guild… treasonous… activities…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta cut in sharply. “Were you acting alone?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No! No!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Inquisitor rapped his cane down before him and leaned forward. “Who gave the orders?” he hissed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Magister Kault!” shouted Hornlach instantly, “he gave the orders!” The audience gasped. Arch Lector Sult smirked a little wider. “It was the Magister!” The quills scratched mercilessly. “It was Kault! He gave the orders! All the orders! Magister Kault!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Thank you, Master Hornlach.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Magister! He gave the orders! Magister Kault! Kault! Kault!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Enough!” snarled Glokta. His prisoner fell silent. The room was still.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Arch Lector Sult lifted his arm and pointed towards the three prisoners. “There is your proof, my Lords!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“This is a sham!” bellowed Lord Brock, leaping to his feet. “This is an insult!” Few voices joined him in support however, and those that did were half-hearted. Lord Heugen was notable for his careful silence, keenly studying the fine leather of his shoes. Barezin had shrunk back into his seat, looking half the size he had been a minute before. Lord Isher was staring off at the wall, fingering his heavy, golden chain, looking bored, as though the fate of the Guild of Mercers was of interest to him no longer.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Brock appealed to the High Justice himself, motionless in his tall chair at the high table. “Lord Marovia, I beg of you! You are a reasonable man! Do not allow this… travesty!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The hall fell silent, waiting for the old man’s reply. He frowned and stroked his long beard. He glanced across at the grinning Arch Lector. He cleared his throat. “I feel your pain, Lord Brock, indeed I do, but it seems that this is not a day for reasonable men. The Closed Council has examined the case and is well satisfied. My hands are tied.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Brock worked his mouth, tasting defeat. “This is not justice!” he shouted, turning round to address his peers. “These men have plainly been tortured!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Arch Lector Sult’s mouth twisted with scorn. “How would you have us deal with traitors and criminals?” he cried in a piercing voice. “Would you raise a shield, Lord Brock, for the disloyal to hide behind?” He thumped the table, as if it too might be guilty of high treason. “I for one will not see our great nation handed over to its enemies! Neither enemies without, nor enemies within!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Down with the Mercers!” came a cry from the public balcony.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hard justice for traitors!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The King’s Justice!” bellowed a fat man near the back. There was a surge of anger and agreement from the floor, and calls for harsh measures and stiff penalties.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Brock looked round for his allies on the front row, but found none. He bunched his fists. “This is no justice!” he shouted, pointing at the three prisoners. “This is no proof!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“His Majesty disagrees!” bellowed Hoff, “and does not require your permission!” He held up a large document. “The Guild of Mercers is hereby dissolved! Their licence revoked by Royal decree! His Majesty’s Commission for Trade and Commerce will, over the coming months, review applications for trade rights with the city of Westport. Until such time as suitable candidates are found, the routes will be managed by capable, </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">loyal</span></span><span class="calibre3">, hands. The hands of His Majesty’s Inquisition.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Arch Lector Sult humbly inclined his head, oblivious to the furious cries from representatives and public gallery alike.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Inquisitor Glokta!” continued the Lord Chamberlain, “the Open Council thanks you for your diligence, and asks that you perform one more service in this matter.” Hoff held out a smaller paper. “This is a warrant for the arrest of Magister Kault, bearing the King’s own signature. We would ask that you serve it forthwith.” Glokta bowed stiffly and took the paper from the Lord Chamberlain’s outstretched hand. “You,” said Hoff, turning his eye on Jalenhorm.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Lieutenant Jalenhorm, my Lord!” shouted the big man, stepping smartly forward.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Whatever,” snapped Hoff impatiently, “take twenty of the King’s Own and escort Inquisitor Glokta to the Mercers’ Guildhall. Ensure that nothing and no one leaves the building without his orders!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“At once, my Lord!” Jalenhorm crossed the floor and ran up the aisle toward the exit, holding the hilt of his sword in one hand to stop it knocking against his leg. Glokta limped after him, cane tapping on the steps, the warrant for the arrest of Magister Kault crumpled in his tightly clenched fist. The monstrous albino had pulled the prisoners to their feet meanwhile, and was leading them, rattling and lolling, off towards the door by which they had entered.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Lord Chamberlain!” shouted Brock, with one last effort. Jezal wondered how much money he must have made from the Mercers. How much he had hoped still to make. A very great deal, evidently.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But Hoff was unmoved. “That concludes our business for today, my Lords!” Marovia was on his feet before the Lord Chamberlain had finished speaking, evidently keen to be away. The great ledgers were thumped shut. The fate of the honourable Guild of Mercers was sealed. Excited babbling filled the air once more, gradually rising in volume and soon joined by clattering and stamping as the representatives began to rise and leave the room. Arch Lector Sult remained seated, watching his beaten adversaries file reluctantly off the front row. Jezal met the desperate eyes of Salem Rews one last time as he was led towards the small door, then Practical Frost jerked at the chain and he was lost in the darkness beyond.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Outside, the square was even busier than before, the dense throng growing ever more excited as the news of the dissolution of the Guild of Mercers spread to those who had not been within. People stood, disbelieving, or hurried here and there: scared, surprised, confused. Jezal saw one man staring at him, staring at anyone, face pale, hands trembling. A Mercer perhaps, or a man in too deep with the Mercers, deep enough to be ruined along with them. There would be many such men.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal felt a sudden tingling. Ardee West was leaning casually against the stones a little further on. They had not met in some time, not since that drunken outburst of hers, and he was surprised how pleased he was to see her. Probably she had been punished long enough, he told himself. Everyone deserved the chance to apologise. He hastened towards her with a broad smile on his lips. Then he noticed who she was with.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That little bastard!” he muttered under his breath.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Lieutenant Brint was chatting freely in his cheap uniform, leaning closer to Ardee than Jezal thought was appropriate, underlining his tedious points with flamboyant gestures of his arms. She was nodding, smiling, then she tipped her head back and laughed, slapping the Lieutenant playfully on the chest. Brint laughed as well, the ugly little shit. They laughed together. For some reason Jezal felt a sharp pang of fury.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Jezal, how are you!” shouted Brint, still giggling.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He stepped up close. “That’s Captain Luthar!” he spat, “and how I am is none of your concern! Don’t you have a job to do?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Brint’s mouth hung stupidly open for a moment, then his brows drew into a surly frown. “Yes, sir,” he muttered, turning and stalking off. Jezal watched him go with a contempt even more intense than usual.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well that was charming,” said Ardee. “Are those the manners you should use before a lady?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I really couldn’t say. Why? Was there one watching?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He turned to look at her and caught, just for a moment, a self-satisfied smirk. Quite a nasty expression, as though she had enjoyed his outburst. He wondered for a silly instant whether she might have arranged the meeting, have placed herself and that idiot where Jezal would see them, hoping to arouse his jealousy… then she smiled at him, and laughed, and Jezal felt his anger fading. She looked very fine, he thought, tanned and vibrant in the sunlight, laughing out loud, not caring who heard. Very fine. Better than ever, in fact. A chance meeting was all, what else could it be? She fixed him with those dark eyes and his suspicions vanished. “Did you have to be so hard on him?” she asked.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal fixed his jaw. “Jumped-up, arrogant nobody, he’s probably nothing more than some rich man’s bastard. No blood, no money, no manners—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“More than me, of all three.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal cursed his big mouth. Rather than dragging an apology from her he was now in need of giving one himself. He sought desperately for some way out of this self-made trap. “Oh, but he’s an absolute moron!” he whined.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well,” and Jezal was relieved to see one corner of Ardee’s mouth curl up in a sly smile, “he is at that. Shall we walk?” She slipped her hand through his arm before he had the chance to answer, and started to lead him off towards the Kingsway. Jezal allowed himself to be guided between the frightened, the angry, the excited people.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So is it true?” she asked.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Is what true?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That the Mercers are finished?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So it seems. Your old friend Sand dan Glokta was in the thick of it. He gave quite the performance, for a cripple.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ardee looked down at the floor. “You wouldn’t want to get on the wrong side of him, crippled or no.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No.” Jezal’s mind went back to Salem Rews’ terrified eyes, staring desperately at him as he vanished into the darkness of the archway. “No, you wouldn’t.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A silence descended on them as they strolled down the avenue, but it was a comfortable one. He liked walking with her. It no longer seemed important whether anyone apologised. Perhaps she had been right about the fencing anyway, just a little. Ardee seemed to read his thoughts. “How’s the swordplay going?” she asked.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not bad. How’s the drinking going?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She raised a dark eyebrow. “Excellent well. If only there was a Contest for that every year, I’d soon come to the attention of the public.” Jezal laughed, looking down at her as she walked beside him, and she smiled back. So clever, so sharp, so fearless. So damn fine looking. Jezal wondered if there had ever been a woman quite like her. If only she had the right blood, he thought to himself, and some money. A lot of money.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_23"></div></div></body>

<div id="filepos787839" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Sore Thumb</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen leaned against the parapet, squinted into the morning sun, and took in the view.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He’d done the same, it felt long ago now, from the balcony of his room at the library. The two views could hardly have been more different. Sunrise over the jagged carpet of buildings on the one hand, hot and glaring bright and full of distant noise. The cold and misty valley on the other, soft and empty and still as death. He remembered that morning, remembered how he’d felt like a different man. He certainly felt a different man now. A stupid man. Small, scared, ugly, and confused.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Logen.” Malacus stepped out onto the balcony to stand beside him, smiled up at the sun and out over the city to the sparkling bay, already busy with ships. “Beautiful, isn’t it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“If you say so, but I’m not sure I see it. All those people.” Logen gave a sweaty shiver. “It’s not right. It frightens me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Frightened? You?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Always.” Logen had barely slept since they arrived. It was never properly dark here, never properly quiet. It was too hot, too close, too stinking. Enemies might be terrifying, but enemies could be fought, and put an end to. Logen could understand their hatred. There was no fighting the faceless, careless, rumbling city. It hated everything. “This is no place for me. I’ll be glad to leave.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We might not be leaving for a while.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I know.” Logen took a deep breath. “That’s why I’m going to go down and look at this Agriont, and find out what I can about it. Some things have to be done. It’s better to do them than to live with the fear of them. That’s what my father used to tell me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good advice. I’ll come with you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You will not.” Bayaz was in the doorway, glaring out at his apprentice. “Your progress over the last few weeks has been a disgrace, even for you.” He stepped through into the open air. “I suggest that while we are idle, waiting on His Majesty’s pleasure, you should take the opportunity to study. Another such chance may be a long time coming.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Malacus hurried back inside with no backward glances. He knew better than to dawdle with his master in this mood. Bayaz had lost all his good humour as soon as they arrived at the Agriont, and it didn’t look like coming back. Logen could hardly blame him, they’d been treated more like prisoners than guests. He didn’t know much about manners, but he could guess the meaning of hard stares from everyone and guards outside the door.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You wouldn’t believe how it’s grown,” growled Bayaz, frowning out at the great sweep of city. “I remember when Adua was barely more than a huddle of shacks, squeezed in round the House of the Maker like flies round a fresh turd. Before there was an Agriont. Before there was a Union, even. They weren’t half so proud in those days, I can tell you. They worshipped the Maker like a god.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He noisily hawked up a lump of phlegm and spat it out into the air. Logen watched it clear the moat and vanish somewhere in amongst the white buildings below. “I gave them this,” hissed Bayaz. Logen felt the unpleasant creeping sensation that always seemed to accompany the old wizard’s displeasure. “I gave them freedom, and this is the thanks I get? The scorn of clerks? Of swollen-headed old errand-boys?” A trip down into the suspicion and madness below began to seem like a merciful release. Logen edged towards the door and ducked back into the room beyond.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">If they were prisoners here then Logen had been in some harder cells, he had to admit. Their round living room was fit for a King, to his mind at least: heavy chairs of dark wood with delicate carvings, thick hangings on the walls showing woods and hunting scenes. Bethod would most likely have felt at home in such a room. Logen felt like an oaf there, always on his toes in case he broke something. A tall jar stood on a table in the chamber’s centre, its sides painted with bright flowers. Logen eyed it suspiciously as he made for the long stair down into the Agriont.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Logen!” Bayaz was framed in the doorway, frowning after him. “Take care. The place may seem strange, but the people are stranger still.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The water frothed and gurgled, spurting up in a narrow jet from a metal tube carved like a fish’s mouth, then splashing back down into a wide stone basin. A fountain, the proud young man had called it. Pipes, beneath the earth, he’d said. Logen pictured underground streams, coursing just beneath his feet, washing at the foundations of the place. The thought made him feel slightly dizzy.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The square was vast—a great plain of flat stones, hemmed in by sheer cliffs of white buildings. Hollow cliffs, covered with pillars and carvings, glittering with tall windows, crawling with people. Something strange seemed to be happening today. All around the distant edges of the square an enormous, sloping structure of wooden beams was being built. An army of workmen swarmed over it, hacking and bludgeoning, swinging at pegs and joints, hurling bad-tempered shouts at each other. All around them were mountains of planks and logs, barrels of nails, stacks of tools, enough to build ten mighty halls, and more besides. In places the structure was already far above the ground, its uprights soaring into the air like the masts of great ships, as high as the monstrous buildings behind.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen stood, hands on hips, gawping at the enormous wooden skeleton, but its purpose was a mystery. He stepped up to a short muscular man in a leather apron, sawing furiously at a plank. “What’s this?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Eh?” The man didn’t even look up from his task.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“This. What’s it for?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The saw bit through the wood, the off-cut clattered to the ground. The carpenter hefted the rest of the plank onto a pile nearby. He turned round, eyeing Logen suspiciously, wiping sweat from his glistening forehead.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Stands. Seating.” Logen stared vacantly back at him. How could something stand and sit at once? “For the Contest!” the carpenter shouted in his face. Logen backed slowly away. Gibberish. Nonsense words. He turned and hurried off, keeping well clear of the huge wooden structures and the men clambering over them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He blundered out onto a broad lane, a deep gorge between looming white buildings. Statues faced each other down either side, much larger than life, frowning over the heads of the many people hurrying between. The nearest of the carvings seemed strangely familiar. Logen walked over to it, looked it up and down, then grinned to himself. The First of the Magi had gained some weight since it was sculpted. Too much good eating at the library, maybe. Logen turned towards a small man with a black hat, walking by with a big book under his arm.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bayaz,” he said, pointing up at the statue. “Friend of mine.” The man stared at him, at the statue, back at him, and hurried away.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The carvings marched on down either side of the avenue. Kings of the Union, Logen guessed, stood in line on the left. Some carried swords, some scrolls or tiny ships. One had a dog at his feet, another a sheaf of wheat under his arm, but otherwise there wasn’t much to tell them apart. They all had the same tall crowns and the same stern frowns. You wouldn’t have thought to look at them that they’d ever said a stupid word, or done a stupid thing, or had to take a shit in all their lives.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen heard rapid footsteps thumping up behind him, and he turned just in time to see the proud young man from the gate, pounding down the avenue, shirt soaked through with sweat. Logen wondered where he might be going in such a hurry, but he was damned if he was going to run to catch up with him, not in this heat. Anyway, there were plenty more mysteries that needed solving.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The lane opened out into a great, green space, scooped out from the country by giant hands and dropped in amongst the tall buildings, but like no countryside that Logen had ever seen. The grass was a smooth, even blanket of vivid green, shaved almost to the ground. There were flowers, but growing in rows and circles and straight lines of bright colour. There were lush bushes and trees, all squeezed and fenced and clipped into unnatural shapes. There was water, too—streams bubbling over stone steps, a great flat pond with sad-looking trees trailing round its edge.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen wandered through this square-edged greenery, boots crunching on a path made of tiny grey stones. There were lots of people gathered here, squeezed in together to enjoy the sun. They sat in boats on the miniature lake, rowing gently round and round, going nowhere. They lazed on the lawns, ate, drank and babbled to one another. Some of them would point at Logen and shout, or whisper, or slope away.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They were a strange-seeming crowd, especially the women. Pale and ghostly, swaddled in elaborate dresses, hair scraped up and piled and stuck through with pins and combs and great weird feathers or useless tiny hats. They seemed like the big jar in the round chamber—too thin and delicate to be any use, and further spoiled by too much decoration. But it had been a long time, and he smiled at them cheerfully, on the off chance. Some looked shocked, others gasped in horror. Logen sighed. The old magic was still there.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Further on, in another wide square, Logen stopped to watch a group of soldiers practice. These weren’t beggars, or girlish youths, these were solid-looking men wearing heavy armour, breastplates and greaves polished mirror bright, long spears shouldered. They stood together, each man the same as the one beside, in four squares of maybe fifty men each, still as the statues in the avenue.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">At a bellow from a short man in a red jacket—their chief, Logen reckoned—the whole crowd turned, levelled their spears and began to advance across the square, heavy boots tramping together. Each man the same, armed the same, moving the same. It was quite a sight, all that shining metal moving steadily in bristling squares, spear points glittering, like some great square hedgehog with two hundred legs. Deadly enough, no doubt, on a big flat space, against an imaginary enemy right in front. How it would work on broken rocks, in the tipping rain, in a tangled wood, Logen was less sure. Those men would tire quickly, in all that weight of armour, and if the squares could be broken, what would they do? Men who were used to always having others at their shoulder? Could they fight alone?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He plodded on, through wide courtyards and neat gardens, past gurgling fountains and proud statues, down clean lanes and broad avenues. He wandered up and down narrow stairways, across bridges over streams, over roads, over other bridges. He saw guards in a dozen different splendid liveries, guarding a hundred different gates and walls and doors, every one eyeing him with the same deep suspicion. The sun climbed in the sky, the tall white buildings slid by until Logen was footsore and half lost, his neck aching from looking always upwards.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The only constant was the monstrous tower which loomed high, high over everything else, making the greatest of the great buildings seem mean. It was always there, glimpsed out of the corner of your eye, peering over the tops of the roofs in the distance. Logen’s footsteps dragged him slowly closer and closer to it, until he came to a neglected corner of the citadel in its very shadow.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He found an old bench beside a ragged lawn near a great crumbling building, coated with moss and ivy, its steep roofs sagging in the middles and missing tiles. He slumped down, puffing out his cheeks, and frowned up at that enormous shape beyond the walls, cut out dark against the blue, a man made mountain of dry, stark, dead stones. No plants clung to that looming mass, not even a clump of moss in the cracks between the great blocks. The House of the Maker, Bayaz had called it. It looked like no house that Logen had ever seen. There were no roofs above, no doors or windows in those naked walls. A cluster of mighty, sharp-edged tiers of rock. What need could there ever be to build a thing so big? Who was this Maker anyway? Was this all he made? A great big, useless house?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You mind if I sit?” There was a woman looking down at Logen, more what he would have called a woman than those strange, ghostly things in the park. A pretty woman in a white dress, face framed by dark hair.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Do I mind? No. It’s a funny thing, but no one else wants to sit with me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She dropped down at the far end of the bench, resting her chin on her hands, her elbows on her knees, gazing up without interest at the looming tower. “Perhaps they’re afraid of you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen watched a man hurry past with a sheaf of papers under his arm, staring at him with wide eyes. “I’m starting to think the same thing.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You do look a little dangerous.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hideous is the word you’re looking for.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I usually find the words I’m looking for, and I say dangerous.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, looks can lie.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She lifted an eyebrow, looking him slowly up and down. “You must be a man of peace then.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh… not entirely.” They looked at each other sidelong. She didn’t seem afraid, or scornful, or even interested. “Why aren’t you scared?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m from Angland, I know your people. Besides,” and she let her head drop onto the back of the bench, “no one else will talk to me. I’m desperate.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen stared at the stump of his middle finger, waggled it back and forth as far as it would go. “You’d have to be. I’m Logen.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good for you. I’m nobody.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Everybody’s somebody.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not me. I’m nothing. I’m invisible.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen frowned at her, turned sideways to him, lounging back on the bench in the sun, her long smooth neck stretched out, chest rising and falling gently. “I see you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She rolled her head to look at him. “You… are a gentleman.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen snorted with laughter. He’d been called a lot of things in his time, but never that. The young woman didn’t join him in his amusement. “I don’t belong here,” she muttered to herself.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Neither one of us.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No. But this is my home.” She got up from the bench. “Goodbye, Logen.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Fare you well, nobody.” He watched her turn and walk slowly away, shaking his head. Bayaz had been right. The place was strange, but the people were stranger still.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen woke with a painful start, blinked and stared wildly about him. Dark. Not quite entirely dark, of course, there was still the ever-present glow of the city. He thought he’d heard something, but there was nothing now. It was hot. Hot and close and strangling, even with the sticky draught from the open window. He groaned, threw the damp blankets down around his waist, rubbed the sweat from his chest and wiped it on the wall behind him. The light nagged at his eyelids. And that was not the worst of his problems. Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say that he needs to piss.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Unfortunately, you couldn’t just piss in a pot in this place. They had a special thing, like a flat wooden shelf with a hole in it, in a little room. He’d peered down into that hole when they first arrived, wondering what it could be for. It seemed like a long way down, and it smelled bad. Malacus had explained it to him. A pointless and barbaric invention. You had to sit there, on the hard wood, an unpleasant draught blowing round your fruits. But that was civilisation, so far as Logen could tell. People with nothing better to do, dreaming up ways to make easy things difficult.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He floundered out of bed and picked his way to where he remembered the door being, bent over with his arms feeling about in front of him. Too light to sleep, but too dark to actually see anything. “Fucking civilisation,” he muttered to himself as he fumbled with the latch on the door, sliding his bare feet cautiously into the big circular room at the centre of their chambers.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was cool in here, very cool. The cold air felt good on his bare skin after the damp heat of his bedroom. Why wasn’t he sleeping in here, instead of that oven next door? He squinted at the shadowy walls, face all screwed up with the painful fuzz of sleep, trying to work out which blurry door led to the pissing-shelf. Knowing his luck he’d probably blunder into Bayaz’ room and accidentally piss on the First of the Magi while he was asleep. That would be just the thing to sweeten the wizard’s temper.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He took a step forward. There was a clunk and a rattle as his leg barged into the corner of the table. He cursed, grabbing at his bruised shin—then he remembered the jar. He lunged and caught it by the rim just before it fell. His eyes were adjusting to the half-light now, and he could just make out the flowers painted on the cold, shiny surface. He moved to put it back on the table, but then it occurred to him. Why go any further when he had a perfectly good pot right there? He glanced furtively round the room, swinging the jar into position… then froze.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was not alone.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A tall, slender figure, vague in the half-light. He could just make out long hair, blowing gently in the breeze from the open window. He strained against the darkness, but he couldn’t see the face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Logen…” A woman’s voice, soft and low. He didn’t like the sound of it one bit. It was cold in the room, very cold. He took a firm grip on the jar.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who are you?” he croaked, voice suddenly loud in the dead stillness. Was he dreaming? He shook his head, squeezed the jar in his hand. It all felt real. Horribly real.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Logen…” The woman moved silently towards him. Soft light from the window caught the side of her face. A white cheek, a shadowy eye-socket, the corner of a mouth, then sunk in darkness again. There was something familiar… Logen’s mind fumbled for it as he backed away, eyes fixed on her outline, keeping the table between them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What do you want?” He had a cold feeling in his chest, a bad feeling. He knew he should be shouting for help, raising the others, but somehow he had to know who it was. Had to know. The air was freezing, Logen could almost see his breath smoking before his face. His wife was dead, he knew that, dead and cold and gone back to the mud, long ago and far away. He’d seen the village, burned to ashes, full of corpses. His wife was dead… and yet…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Thelfi?” he whispered.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Logen…” Her voice! Her voice! His mouth dropped open. She reached out for him, through the light from the window. Pale hand, pale fingers, long, white nails. The room was icy, icy cold. “Logen!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re dead!” He raised the jar, ready to smash it down on her head. The hand reached out, fingers spreading wide.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Suddenly, the room was bright as day. Brighter. Brilliant, searing bright. The murky outlines of the doors, the furniture, were transformed into hard white edges, black shadows. Logen squeezed his eyes shut, shielded them with his arm, dropped back gasping against the wall. There was a deafening crash like a landslide, a tearing and splintering like a great tree falling, a stink of burning wood. Logen opened one eye a crack, peered out from between his fingers.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The chamber was strangely altered. Dark, once more, but less dark than before. Light filtered in through a great ragged hole in the wall where the window used to be. Two of the chairs had gone, a third teetered on three legs, broken edges glowing faintly, smouldering like sticks that had been a long time in a fire. The table, standing right beside him just a moment before, was sheared in half on the other side of the room. Part of the ceiling had been torn away from the rafters and the floor was littered with chunks of stone and plaster, broken lengths of wood and fragments of glass. Of the strange woman there was no sign.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz picked his way unsteadily through the wreckage towards the gaping hole in the wall, nightshirt flapping around his thick calves, and peered out into the night. “It’s gone.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It?” Logen stared at the steaming hole. “She knew my name…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The wizard stumbled over to the last remaining intact chair and flung himself into it like a man exhausted. “An Eater, perhaps. Sent by Khalul.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A what?” asked Logen, baffled. “Sent by who?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz wiped sweat from his face. “You wanted not to know.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s true.” Logen couldn’t deny it. He rubbed at his chin, staring out of the ragged patch of night sky, wondering whether now might be a good time to change his mind. But by then it was too late. There was a frantic hammering at the door.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Get that, would you?” Logen stumbled stupidly through the debris and slid back the bolt. An angry-looking guard shouldered his way past, a lamp in one hand, drawn sword in the other.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There was a noise!” The light from his lamp swept over the wreckage, found the ragged edge of the ripped plaster, the broken stone, the empty night sky beyond. “Shit,” he whispered.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We had an uninvited guest,” muttered Logen.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Er… I must notify…” the guard looked thoroughly confused “…somebody.” He tripped and nearly fell over a fallen beam as he backed towards the door. Logen heard his footsteps rattling away down the stairs.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What’s an Eater?” There was no reply. The wizard was asleep, eyes closed, a deep frown on his face, chest moving slowly. Logen looked down. He was surprised to see he still had the pot, beautiful and delicate, clasped tightly in his right hand. He carefully swept clear a space on the floor and set the jar down, in amongst the wreckage.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">One of the doors banged open and Logen’s heart jumped. It was Malacus, wild-eyed and staring, hair sticking up off his head at all angles. “What the…” He stumbled to the hole and peered gingerly out into the night. “Shit!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Malacus, what’s an Eater?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Quai’s head snapped round to look at Logen, his face a picture of horror. “It’s forbidden,” he whispered, “to eat the flesh of men…”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_30"></div></div></body>

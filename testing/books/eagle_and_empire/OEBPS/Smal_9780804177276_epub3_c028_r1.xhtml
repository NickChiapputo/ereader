<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">W</span>ith so much going on, Marcellinus had stopped paying attention to the boy. So had everyone else. Now the word slave shinned off his horse, ducked behind the horse of the Keshik separating him from the Khan, and leaped up at him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Someone behind Chinggis must have shouted out a warning, because the Khan began to move even as the boy grabbed him by the belt and drove the knife up and under his armor. Chinggis’s arm dealt Pezi a heavy blow. At the same time both of the Khan’s bodyguards dropped their bows and drew steel, the first whipping his saber down so fast that it was a blur. Startled by the sudden activity, the Khan’s horse bucked and kicked. The kick missed Pezi, but as the horse’s hooves came down again, they scored the boy’s legs. Pezi screamed.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan twisted, peering down at himself. Blood from his wound had splashed down onto his horse’s flanks.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Split.” Sintikala spurred her horse to the right. Marcellinus felt an instant of fear as she left his side.</p>
<p class="para-p">Keshik warriors were converging on them. Marcellinus leaned forward, kicked at his increasingly reluctant horse, managed to dodge around two warriors who were heading for Hanska, and galloped into the suddenly appearing space, straight toward Chinggis Khan.</p>
<p class="para-p">He reached behind him, and his questing hand found the third javelin in the quiver behind his saddle. He dragged it free.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page446" title="446"/>
<p class="para-p">Chinggis shouted an order, his high voice cutting through the din. The bodyguards to either side of the Khan recovered their composure and raised their bows once again.</p>
<p class="para-p">A Mongol arrow drove through Marcellinus’s breastplate and into his chest. The arrow did not knock him back and did not reach his heart, but as his horse kept up its gallop, the iron point grated against his rib, making him howl. He tried to raise his lance, and the pain came again, almost unbearable.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Keshik guards moved forward. On the ground behind the Khan, Pezi shoved himself shakily upright. Blood poured from his chest and legs, but the knife was still in his hand, and this time he thrust it up under the barding of the Khan’s horse, slashing the animal deeply in the thigh.</p>
<p class="para-p">Even as Marcellinus saw that, he was suddenly flying, airborne with no idea why. The ground came up to meet him and smashed the wind from him.</p>
<p class="para-p">His horse had thrown him and was cantering away, snorting and squealing. The spatha had disappeared from his right hand, but his left still clutched the javelin. He looked up in time to see Sintikala hurl herself bodily off her horse and crash into the second Keshik. The bodyguard was not as lucky as Marcellinus. He got caught in his stirrups and flailed, painfully falling sideways.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus came up onto one knee, gasping, looking for enemies. Where had the Mongol Khan disappeared to?</p>
<p class="para-p">Behind him. The Khan’s horse had bucked again at the sudden stab to its thigh and had leaped past Marcellinus. Chinggis mostly had it under control, although it still tossed its head and rolled its eyes.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus snapped the arrow that still jutted from his chest, threw it aside, and stood. Chinggis drew his saber. Six more Keshiks hurried forward, two on mounts and four on foot. Behind the Khan, Hanska’s Third Cahokian had caught up to her, and Chernye Klobuki were pouring in to engage the Keshiks.</p>
<p class="para-p">Two arrows plinked off Marcellinus’s back. A third grazed his helmet. He had to move.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page447" title="447"/>
<p class="para-p">Hardly thinking anymore, trying to shove aside his fear and ignore the grating pain in his chest, Marcellinus ran forward with javelin raised.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan’s horse’s ears went back. Chinggis slapped its flanks with his whip, then dropped the lash as the horse began to canter forward. The Khan raised his saber.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala had killed her Keshik and was fighting two more as the Chernye came in, firing arrows and slashing with their sabers. The field around them was a mass of mounted warriors battling hand to hand, with Marcellinus and Sintikala the only ones on foot and separated by two dozen yards.</p>
<p class="para-p">As the Mongol Khan ran him down, slashing with the saber, Marcellinus hurled his javelin and threw himself aside. Trying to thrust at the Khan while still holding it would have been deadly dangerous; the impact would have knocked Marcellinus off his feet.</p>
<p class="para-p">The javelin drove into the horse’s leather barding just above the throat and hung there. The horse flinched and tossed its head back but looked to have suffered little injury.</p>
<p class="para-p">A heavy pilum would have served Marcellinus well now, but his only remaining weapon was the gladius that hung from his belt. He drew it and waited for the Khan to swing his horse around into another charge.</p>
<p class="para-p">It did not happen. The horse reared, still in pain from the wound Pezi had inflicted, and skittered in distress. The Khan swung his feet out of the stirrups, dropped to the ground in a single motion, and strode forward toward Marcellinus.</p>
<p class="para-p">As he did, he sheathed his saber and drew a mace from the strap that had held it on his back.</p>
<p class="para-p">The mace was a much longer and heavier weapon than a gladius. This was now a very one-sided fight.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus eyed him warily. Chinggis Khan was shorter than Marcellinus, but his shoulders and arms bulged with muscle. Fifteen years Marcellinus’s senior, the Khan still looked strong and hale, his graying hair the only sign of his age. Chinggis moved like a warrior, hefted the mace one-handed as if it were a toy, and eyed Marcellinus with predatory intent.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page448" title="448"/>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol Khan was a dangerous opponent, and again Marcellinus felt a quite uncharacteristic surge of fear.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I am not kneeling at your feet now,” he said to the Mongol Khan. “You should have killed me when I was.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan could not have understood him but spit out a few words in a steady voice, his tone almost hypnotic. Ten feet from Marcellinus, he cut the air with a swing of the mace and raised it over his head again.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus stepped forward. His gladius felt like a toothpick in his hand by comparison.</p>
<p class="para-p">He needed the battle fury that gave him confidence, or the fight was already lost. He tried to recall the slaughter at Yupkoyvi, Enopay’s fear, the callous burning of the Roman soldier by the Jin.</p>
<p class="para-p">And then Hanska screamed. Marcellinus flicked a glance to his left. She was fighting, her ax coming down and swinging around again so fast that it almost eluded the eye, dueling with a Keshik in an attempt to get past him for her own chance at the Mongol Khan. Her scream was not of pain but of raw, relentless, berserker anger.</p>
<p class="para-p">And on breathing in her rage, Marcellinus felt it, too.</p>
<p class="para-p">War be damned. Roma be damned. Marcellinus owed it to Hanska to kill this man.</p>
<p class="para-p">He leaped forward, suddenly careless of the disparity of weapons between himself and the Mongol Khan. The saber was a slashing weapon and the mace a swinging weapon, and they were what the Khan was used to, and so Marcellinus ended his leap by thrusting the gladius forward in a direct and unsubtle line straight at the Khan’s face.</p>
<p class="para-p">Unable to parry at that speed, the Khan stepped left to avoid the blade. His mace came around, as quick as Hanska’s ax, and swooped toward Marcellinus’s head. Such a blow would surely kill him. Marcellinus dodged it, jumping to his right to follow the Khan’s direction. He was watching Chinggis’s eyes, alert for any tell that might give away the Khan’s next move.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus whipped the gladius forward. Its blade struck the Khan’s gauntlet and glanced off. It was Chinggis’s right hand, the hand that held the mace, but that hand was uninjured and still in motion, swinging the heavy weapon. Marcellinus lunged with the gladius again and only at the last moment saw the rock in the Khan’s left hand.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page449" title="449"/>
<p class="para-p">Pulling his strike, Marcellinus jumped back. The rock flew from the Khan’s hand and struck Marcellinus’s shoulder. If he had not retreated, it would have flown into his face.</p>
<p class="para-p">As they separated, the Khan pulled his saber out of his belt with his left hand. Marcellinus sneered and pulled out his pugio. Both men glanced left and right, but they were unassailed. The melee still raged around them. Marcellinus could hear Hanska grunting as she traded blow after blow with her Keshik adversary, but for him and the Khan, their own duel was the only one that mattered.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus moved left. The mace was still in Chinggis’s right hand, and crowding the Khan a little would help reduce his advantage from having the longer weapon. From the way Chinggis held his saber Marcellinus could tell the man was not a truly ambidextrous fighter, but the risk was plain: if Marcellinus swung his gladius and the Khan parried with the saber, Marcellinus would have no time to protect himself from the blow from the mace that would follow.</p>
<p class="para-p">He was still watching the Khan’s eyes, and the Khan was watching his. The Khan was not gripped by battle ardor. He was cold and calculating, constantly measuring distances, gauging responses, evaluating threats.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s anger still burned. He feinted left; the Khan reacted immediately. He ducked left again and swung, but the Khan jumped and lifted his mace, and both men fell back. A failed blow by either man might be his last.</p>
<p class="para-p">Behind the Khan, Hanska lost her footing and tumbled over backward. She shrieked and rolled, but the Keshik was upon her. And Marcellinus’s rage became unbearable.</p>
<p class="para-p">Time to take a leaf out of Hanska’s book. Marcellinus bellowed, a sudden blast of sound, and saw a flicker of uncertainty in the Khan’s eyes a moment before he leaped.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus threw himself forward, gladius held high. The Khan slashed with the saber; Marcellinus twisted so that the blow bounced off his shoulder rather than cutting into his neck. Chinggis raised the mace to parry Marcellinus’s sword, but instead of swinging it down, Marcellinus punched forward again, the pommel of the sword crunching into the Khan’s nose.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page450" title="450"/>
<p class="para-p">Chinggis Khan shrieked. Landing almost on top of the Khan, Marcellinus stabbed his pugio into Chinggis’s neck below the leather flaps of his helmet. Blood spurted. The mace clipped Marcellinus’s head. It was the wooden shaft and not the heavy ball at its tip, but Marcellinus’s head rang, and for a dangerous moment his vision swam.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan dropped the mace and swung, his gauntlet slamming into Marcellinus’s cheek.</p>
<p class="para-p">Suddenly the gladius was gone from Marcellinus’s hand. He whipped the pugio around again and missed. The Khan stepped back and switched the saber back into his right hand, his left clutching at his neck.</p>
<p class="para-p">The saber came around. Marcellinus held up an armored forearm and kicked out at the Khan’s knee. The saber glanced off his arm, and he kicked again.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan went down. Marcellinus grabbed his helmet with an iron grip, and threw all his weight forward.</p>
<p class="para-p">He looked up, and she was running toward him: Hanska of Cahokia, screaming, her ax high.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol Khan struggled. Marcellinus leaned on the man to hold him firm. Blood still poured from the conqueror’s neck.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska slowed to a walk and quietened. She seemed suddenly mesmerized by the Khan. She had probably dreamed of this moment for a long time.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Khan saw her coming. He still struggled, but his blood was spilling over Marcellinus’s hands, and he appeared to be weakening.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus stole quick glances around him. Keshiks were on their knees, facing him. Cahokians and Romans stood over them, sweating. The furor of the battles taking place farther away had not abated, but close by, at least, everyone knew it was over. Out of the corner of his eye Marcellinus saw Pezi crawling forward, dragging himself toward them. Aelfric was to his left, panting, covered in mud.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page451" title="451"/>
<p class="para-p">“Now, Hanska,” Marcellinus said. “He’s yours.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska nodded. “For Mikasi,” she said, almost sadly.</p>
<p class="para-p">She measured the distance, swung her heavy ax. It smashed into Chinggis Khan’s face, sinking deep into his skull. The strength of the impact knocked Marcellinus backward into the mud, the dead Khan lying across his legs.</p>
<p class="para-p">All around them the Keshiks moaned, almost a keening sound, at the death of their beloved leader. The Romans and Hesperians stood silent. Perhaps they couldn’t believe their eyes. Pezi made a strange noise that might have been a cough or a short laugh, that he cut off quickly.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska looked into the Khan’s ruined face, then calmly pulled off his helmet and brought out her pugio to scalp him. Her face was a mask; if anything, she looked thoughtful rather than exultant. Perhaps she had never expected to see the Khan lying dead. Perhaps she had never expected to survive this battle.</p>
<p class="para-p">As she carved into the Khan’s hairline, the Keshiks ceased their keening and lowered their heads as if in prayer. One began to sob quietly. More blood poured onto Marcellinus’s chest.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska stood and fastened the conqueror’s bloody scalp to her belt, then looked down to where Marcellinus sat, his muscles still quivering with the effort, shaken by the blows to his head, body, and arms.</p>
<p class="para-p">She lifted the body of the Khan off him. “Up you come, sir.” Marcellinus held out a hand, and Hanska hauled him to his feet.</p>
<p class="para-p">Instead of letting go, she pulled him closer and stared into his eyes. There he saw deep gratitude, respect, and sorrow. He nodded, and Hanska squeezed his hand and released him without comment.</p>
<p class="para-p">Around them the struggle had abated, at least in the immediate area. The wind had picked up, but patchy smoke still swirled around them. Those Mongol warriors who could see that their leader had fallen were backing away, trying to withdraw without showing their backs to the Chernye Klobuki and the Polovtsians, who would kill them as soon as they turned tail.</p>
<p class="para-p">Other Keshiks, however, were moving in to converge upon Marcellinus.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page452" title="452"/>
<p class="para-p">Shit. Did he have to fight yet again? He didn’t think he could. He was all-done.</p>
<p class="para-p">Aelfric strolled to his side. “So, Praetor. That drink you offered me after I helped you kill Corbulo. Did I ever get it?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I don’t think so. Sorry.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Bloody typical. Yet here I am again.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Here you are again.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Then they heard a single voice, wailing. Marcellinus turned around, almost irritated and still a little dazed, trying to figure out where it was coming from. One of the Keshik?</p>
<p class="para-p">It was Pezi. Pezi was somehow standing, holding himself up by clutching the saddle of his horse, and he was weeping and wailing and crying out words in the Mongol tongue. Then he switched briefly to Cahokian and in the same wailing tone cried out: “Wanageeska! I am spreading the word that their Khan is dead. Put me on a horse! Do not leave me here!”</p>
<p class="para-p">A dozen yards from Pezi a Keshik warrior smashed a Polovtsian cavalryman to the ground and jerked his horse’s head around. Seeing and hearing Pezi, he spurred his horse forward, heading for the boy. But Sintikala was faster, cantering her horse to Pezi’s side in his defense.</p>
<p class="para-p">Again came Pezi’s voice. “Let them leave, Wanageeska! Give the Keshiks the body of the Khan and let them leave! Trust me, Wanageeska! Do it!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Trust <em class="char-i">him</em>?” said Aelfric.</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi, once a coward and a liar, had come through at exactly the right moment at tremendous risk to himself. Marcellinus could not have defeated the Khan without the word slave’s courage. “Absolutely,” he said, and raised his voice. “Do as he says! Back up! Let them leave!” He repeated it in Latin for the Chernye.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Cahokians and Chernye Klobuki withdrew together, away from the Khan’s body. The Keshiks walked past them to stand by their fallen leader.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala rode over to Marcellinus. How she had gotten her horse back, Marcellinus didn’t know; he had no idea where his own had gone. She gestured for him to climb up behind her, and he gave it a try, but with the arrow wound to his chest and the bruising to his arms and back, there was no way. “I can’t.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page453" title="453"/>
<p class="para-p">She looked alarmed. “Will you live?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes. If you don’t make me get up there.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala blinked. Then she got off the horse and put her arms around him for just a moment. He could feel her heart pumping hard. She was breathing heavily, chest moving in and out. He wanted to hold her, but it was too painful. “I love you, Sintikala.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I love you, Gaius. Let us do this. Hold on to me.” She put his foot into the stirrup and half pushed, half lifted him until he could get into the saddle, bracing himself on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Let them leave!” Marcellinus shouted to the Chernye, to anyone who could hear him. Damn, even shouting was agony with that accursed arrowhead still lodged in his rib. “Let…Futete.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala raised her voice. “Let the Mongols depart to spread the word among their people that their Khan has fallen!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Exactly,” Marcellinus said. “Thank you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Taking the horse’s reins, Sintikala walked him over to where Pezi still howled. “Shut up now,” she said. “They’re going.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi peered up at Marcellinus. “You came for me. Thank you and thank you…If you had not, the Keshiks would have taken me. As the Khan’s servant they would have killed me to serve him in the afterlife.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols were trying to lift Chinggis Khan’s body onto his horse, but the horse was resisting their efforts. Eventually they gave it up and raised him onto their shoulders instead. Grouping up, they walked eastward. From a safe distance the Romans, Chernye, and Cahokians watched them go.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Once again you owe the Wanageeska a life,” Sintikala said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi’s face cracked into a grin that quickly contorted with pain. “Or perhaps the Wanageeska now owes me one!”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">A battle spread over such a large area, broken into so many distinct parts and amid such confusion, could not be ended all at once. It took trumpets and dispatch riders on the Roman side and drums, signal flags, and post riders on the Mongol side. It took a giant wailing Mongol horn sounding from far back from the battlefield. It took the defeat of another two hundred Mongols and Jin on foot bearing fire lances, with substantial deaths among the centuries of the Third Parthica that resisted them. Other jaghuns, seeking revenge, attempted to drive a Chisel Formation into groups of tired Romans, but the news of the Mongol Khan’s death had spread among the legions, too, cheering them and stiffening their spines, and few of the vengeance attacks resulted in major Roman casualties. Other skirmishes and smaller actions continued until the end of the afternoon.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page454" title="454"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus and Sintikala, the Third Cahokian, the Chernye Klobuki, and other remaining mounted regiments of Roma regrouped with the Third Parthica in the late afternoon. By then Pezi was draped unconscious on his Mongol horse, and Marcellinus yearned to be safely unconscious, too. For all his wounds, aches, and pains, he could have fallen asleep in the saddle.</p>
<p class="para-p">But that luxury was not for him. Agrippa, the Praetorians, and several cohorts of the 27th had already left the field, clustered in a strong defensive formation around their wounded Imperator.</p>
<p class="para-p">Agrippa had left the phased withdrawal of the rest of the army to its tribunes, but Marcellinus had no idea what orders the other Praetor might have given. He could leave nothing to chance. The remains of this bloody and smoky battlefield, strewn with the bodies of dead men and horses, now appeared to be his responsibility.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Contact my tribunes,” he said to his Roman adjutants and Norse scouts once he found them. “I need reports from every cohort as soon as you can. Sooner.” He turned to Napayshni and Takoda. “You two: the same. Get reports and locations from Tahtay and Wahchintonka. And the Thunderbird clan. Does anyone know what happened to Chenoa’s Wakinyan? Any signals? And if you see Chumanee, I need her right now. Don’t send me a medicus. Send me Chumanee. Enopay, you’re with me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">And later, to the tribunes of the Third: “Find the freshest cavalry. Collect your scouts. Break it to them that their day is not over. The Mongols might even now be sending jaghuns to flank us. I don’t think so, but they might, and we don’t have enough birds in the air to watch for them. Send scouts west, patrols and skirmishers south and north. Find trumpeters to go with them.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page455" title="455"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus did not lead his troops back to Forward Camp. Once the Sixth had mopped up the fire lancers and chased away the last of the Mongol heavy infantry, Aurelius Dizala took command and retreated along with the survivors of the Third Parthica, conveying and safeguarding the Roman wounded as best they could. The Hesperian League—Tahtay, Akecheta, and the First Cahokian, along with the Wolf Warriors, the Iroqua, the Blackfoot, and the Hand—had chosen to return separately. Marcellinus wondered what they had talked about on their long walk home to Forward Camp.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus and Sintikala finally withdrew from the battlefield, escorted by Aelfric’s Sixth Cohort, Hanska’s Third Cahokian, and the Ninth Syrian. On the way Kimimela found them, careering down to earth in front of them in an untidy and exhausted landing that snapped her right wing strut and made Sintikala shake her head disapprovingly even as Kimi ran to hug them both, half crying.</p>
<p class="para-p">Once she composed herself, she gave her report from the flying clans.</p>
<p class="para-p">It turned out that Chenoa’s Wakinyan had made it to the Wemissori after all. Two of her Thunderbirds managed to fly across and land on the far side. Others came down on the near bank, but sufficiently distant from the closest Mongol mounted squadrons that they could cross the river in safety. One overly optimistic Wakinyan crew had tried to fly to the far bank but crash-landed midriver, and two pilots had drowned before they could be cut free from their craft.</p>
<p class="para-p">Those drownings were the only casualties the Thunderbird clan had suffered in their whole day of war making. The Hawk clan was not so fortunate; Kimimela was brusque and imprecise about the numbers, but Marcellinus’s best guess was that they had lost perhaps two dozen Catanwakuwa pilots. Some had been forced to land behind enemy lines and had been killed instantly, and others had been shot down in dogfights with the Firebirds and Feathered Serpents. Kimimela had barely survived her own aerial battle with the Firebird. Several well-aimed slingshot pellets had forced the Firebird to lose height, and its pilots had chosen to fly back behind the Mongol lines rather than continue to fight her.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page456" title="456"/>
<p class="para-p">Others had, however, been saved. Five Hawk pilots had suffered disabling attacks to their wings at altitude. Cutting themselves free, they had drifted to earth under their Falling Leaf canopies. Four had survived unscathed. A fifth had broken both ankles in the violence of her landing, but at least she was still alive.</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela climbed up on Sintikala’s horse behind her, and they cantered east to take control of the Hawk clan. After so long on the ground, Sintikala was keen to get back into the air before nightfall to see for herself where the Mongol forces were, find out whether any Hesperian forces were stranded, and see if she could determine where the Sky Lantern pilots had landed.</p>
<p class="para-p">Once they left, Aelfric pulled in beside Marcellinus, and they led the last cohorts home.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Whew.” Aelfric whistled. “This’ll be a tale to tell your grandkids.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus shook his head. “Kimimela doesn’t want children.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Aelfric grinned. “So she says now. Ah, well. In that case you’ll just have to tell it to mine.”</p></div></body></html>

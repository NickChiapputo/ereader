<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">M</span>arcellinus had barely regained his place back behind the First Cohort when the phalanx of the Shappa Ta’atani crashed into the center of his front line. Just before impact Dizala’s cohorts raised a sudden ruckus, banging their spears against the iron rims of their shields. If the abrupt din threw fear into the warriors of Son of the Sun, it was not apparent from where Marcellinus stood.</p>
<p class="para-p">Shields clashed, and steel rang against steel. Dizala’s troops had stepped up, punching their shield bosses into the Shappan line and following with overhand spear thrusts. The legionaries behind surged forward to hold the line firm. The Shappans who did not go down immediately swung their axes and clubs, and each legionary tried to catch the impact on the steel rim of his scuta rather than the flat. Where they failed, Marcellinus heard splintering and screeches of pain where the axes cleaved the wood, but the line held, his soldiers still powering forward to split the Shappan ranks. The cohorts advanced six feet, then eight, and then the Shappan line stood firm. Their spears mostly lodged in Shappan bodies, the leading Romans drew gladii.</p>
<p class="para-p">The leading line of Mongol horsemen was three hundred yards distant and approaching at a canter. Although Marcellinus could not see all the ranks of the cavalry that faced him, he knew from his Sky Lantern’s signals that the Mongol force was moving forward in five lines, each separated by about two hundred yards. The first two lines were heavy cavalry, with more horse archers making up the ranks that followed.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page353" title="353"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus knew what would happen next. Aelfric and the other tribunes would know, too. There was no preparing for it, no orders he could give that would help. They just had to wait.</p>
<p class="para-p">Takoda trotted up to bring Marcellinus his shield, a large oval in the cavalry style. “Should I stay with you?” the brave asked quietly.</p>
<p class="para-p">Cahokian company was not unwelcome. And at this time of all times, Marcellinus remembered a much younger Takoda coming to cut his bonds with a chert blade at dawn on his very first day in the Great City as he lay out in the open at the base of a red cedar pole, wounded and desolate and waiting for death. He and Takoda had been through a lot together in the intervening years. “If you would.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Takoda was a warrior, but also a gentle man who loved his family and his neighbors, who loved Cahokia and the Mizipi and all of the land. He did not deserve to be at the hub of a war between two invading foreign powers that eventually might decide the fate of the world.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked again at the Mongol line. More than anything, he wanted them all wiped from the earth.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol heavy cavalry lumbered forward. And now they were at arrow range, and their stirrup-to-stirrup formation was parting to make channels for the light cavalry.</p>
<p class="para-p">They poured through, sleek and merciless in their gray leather armor, standing in their stirrups, raising their bodies clear of their wooden saddles with those devastating composite bows in their hands.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Testudo!” Marcellinus roared, and beside him Takoda jumped at his sudden shout, his horse backing up. But his First Cohort was doing it, the front rank dropping to one knee with shields angled, the ranks behind raising scuta to interlock them over their heads against the arrow shower.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol horsemen galloped through, a steady stream of light cavalry, and turned to form an oblique line. They were already loosing arrows in waves, their horses maintaining formation. It was amazing that so few warriors could pump out so many arrows so quickly, but now Marcellinus saw that the horse archers behind the heavy cavalry were also firing arrows up at forty-five degrees to rain down on the legionaries.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page354" title="354"/>
<p class="para-p">The First Cohort staggered back as the onslaught struck. At such close range, arrows from those Mongol composite bows might punch through chain mail or even a breastplate. Shields and helmets would protect the areas they covered, but they still left plenty of vulnerability.</p>
<p class="para-p">Amid the arrows came the crackle and flash of black powder grenades. The Mongols were hurling pots of the Jin salt into the midranks of the First. Black smoke wafted up where they struck. Men fell, others moving forward to take their place. A few hundred yards away Marcellinus’s left wing was suffering the same barrage.</p>
<p class="para-p">The first wave of Mongol light cavalry curved away to the right. Behind them the heavies spurred their horses, spears at the ready.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus assessed quickly. Shappan warriors forming a solid phalanx of infantry to assault the center of his line. Mongol archers loosing arrows and flinging pots of black powder. And the Mongol heavy cavalry thundering in to drive home the advantage.</p>
<p class="para-p">This was a coordinated assault as sophisticated as any Marcellinus had seen in any of his former campaigns, and it was flawlessly executed. Sabinus was right. The Mongols had come a long way.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Second and Third Cohorts were still deep in combat with the ranked warriors of Shappa Ta’atan. Right in front of Marcellinus his First Cohort was only now recovering. Forced into disarray by the intensity of the arrow attack, his men were not yet ready to engage. A few moments earlier he had seen the crest of Appius Gallus bobbing on the left corner of the First, perilously close to the melee but looking the other way, undoubtedly shouting orders at his front line. But now Marcellinus could not see his primus pilus at all.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus urged his horse forward between the First and Second Cohorts. “Pila! Pila, damn you!”</p>
<p class="para-p">The men reacted to him out of quick instinct. Their shields came down, and the heavy pila came up into position. As Marcellinus arrived just behind the front line, the second and third ranks dropped their pila between the men in front of them, grinding the spear butts into the dirt, their sharp tips pointing up at an angle to form a bristling hedge.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page355" title="355"/>
<p class="para-p">And just in time, because the Mongol heavy cavalry was upon them.</p>
<p class="para-p">No horses—not even the ugly, wild, and aggressive Mongol ponies—would ride headlong into a mass of armed men. But the Mongol arrows and the daunting sight of the heavy cavalry bearing down on the line had had their effect; already the line was buckling as men stepped back. Marcellinus heard Gallus yelling and now saw the First Centurion several ranks back in his cohort, shoving men into position.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol heavies carried vicious hooked spears that were twelve feet long. Right behind the line of heavy cavalry were two more lines of light cavalry, firing arrows into the Roman line between the armored horses of their own heavies. Marcellinus found an instant to admire both their courage and their recklessness and also to curse the calm confidence with which Lucius Agrippa had assured him that the Mongols would not come to the melee until they had to, would keep their distance and rely on missile fire until their hands were forced…but the Khan’s shock troops had come to the fore in the first minutes of battle.</p>
<p class="para-p">And gods, it had almost worked. The First Cohort, supposedly the toughest and most experienced cohort of the Sixth Ironclads, had nearly collapsed in the face of their charge.</p>
<p class="para-p">Horses galloped up from behind Marcellinus as his adjutants arrived to defend him. From his left he heard Aulus snarl, “Jupiter’s sake, sir, get back!” More practically, Sollonius handed him a heavy pilum, at the same time inserting himself between his Praetor and the front line.</p>
<p class="para-p">Right behind Sollonius was Takoda. So much for Marcellinus keeping the young brave out of harm’s way…</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol heavies waded into the front line of the Sixth Ferrata. Their long spears thrust past the sharp briar patch of Roman steel. But the First was rising to the occasion again at last, the men pushing forward to shove their scuta into the faces of the Mongol horses even as the Mongol warriors leaned over to smash clubs and axes into those shields. Legionaries stabbed their pila forward, knocking Mongols back and sometimes off their steeds. Close to Marcellinus two legionaries fell to their knees, slain almost simultaneously with arrows buried deep in their chests. The men behind them tried to bull their way forward, but their path was blocked by the bodies.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page356" title="356"/>
<p class="para-p">Not so far away half a dozen legionaries had broken formation to drag Mongol warriors from horseback. Two of the Romans fell, but the others thrust their gladii deep into the warriors’ bodies, mindless of the horses’ hooves rearing above their heads.</p>
<p class="para-p">The second rank of Mongol heavy cavalry was forcing itself into the fray, cleaving the Roman line. Two Mongols came straight for Marcellinus. Spurring his horse forward, Marcellinus raised his pilum high and swung it down into the mailed chest of the nearer of them. It did not breach the man’s armor. Beside him Sollonius slashed at the horse’s face with his gladius, and it neighed and backed up. Aulus nocked an arrow and loosed it even as his horse reared. The arrow buried itself in the Mongol cavalryman’s arm.</p>
<p class="para-p">The second Mongol threw his spear. With no time to bring his shield around, Marcellinus instinctively shoved with his legs, standing in the saddle, and the heavy spear’s tip slammed into his breastplate instead of his neck or face. But the spear’s weight smashed him back, and he sprawled onto his horse’s rump, in danger of being unseated.</p>
<p class="para-p">He felt himself jerked upright. It was Takoda, yanking on his arm. Sollonius was trading sword blows with the first Mongol horseman, and Aulus had grabbed the reins of Marcellinus’s horse to steady it. “Back!” Aulus was shouting, his face set, eyes furious. “Back, back, <em class="char-i">now</em>!”</p>
<p class="para-p">In front of him the front lines of the First wrestled with the Mongol heavies. Not thirty feet behind him the legionaries of his Second Cohort were still in combat with the warriors of Shappa Ta’atan. Arrows, stones, and the occasional black powder grenade tumbled down on the rearward ranks of his cohorts. A pall of smoke was building over them all as Marcellinus allowed himself to be steered back into the middle of his army by his adjutants.</p>
<p class="para-p">“All right, damn it, give me my horse.” Now safely behind the First, Marcellinus plucked the reins of his horse from Aulus’s hands. Next to him the Seventh Cohort had arrayed into a battle line, facing right, with the Eighth hurrying to fall into position beside it. Smart, smart; the Mongol line of horsemen might curve around to flank them at any moment. At the far end of the line of the Sixth he saw Aelfric on foot, running with his gladius in his hand and his scutum high over his head, pulling some of his centuries in line with Ifer’s Tenth. Something critical was happening over there on his left, but he would have to leave it to Ifer and Aelfric for now—</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page357" title="357"/>
<p class="para-p">Above Marcellinus, the Sky Lantern exploded.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Fuck!” Aulus shouted, profoundly rattled. “Fuck everything!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Easy, soldier,” Marcellinus said, and looked up.</p>
<p class="para-p">The cotton bag of the Sky Lantern was ablaze, hot red flames licking up its side. A man fell from it, a legionary, windmilling in the air until he crashed to earth far behind the Ninth and mercifully beyond Marcellinus’s sight. The other pilots clung to the frame except for one of the Ravens, who appeared to be standing on the wooden platform slashing with an ax. As Marcellinus watched, the fire jar dropped from the center of the frame, tumbling to earth to shatter into a thousand flaming pieces.</p>
<p class="para-p">But nothing could lighten the Lantern enough to save it. It began to fall out of the air. Another man, a Cahokian this time, lost his grip and plummeted to the ground.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Raven still standing was Chogan. Marcellinus saw him shake his head and then deliberately leap clear of the Sky Lantern in a graceful swan dive. Above him a square of cloth opened, jerking him in the air to sway beneath it.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was the first use of a Falling Leaf from altitude. For obvious reasons, they had never tested it from a killing height with a human being before.</p>
<p class="para-p">Still blazing, the remains of the Sky Lantern crumpled to earth. Chogan followed it down, his arms and legs thrashing as if he were trying to climb away from the ground as it came up to meet him. The cotton square of the Falling Leaf fluttered above him. It was arresting his speed, but would it be enough?</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked away, feeling sick. And in moving his head he now caught sight of a Feathered Serpent of the Yokot’an Maya rippling away, writhing northward back across the sky toward the Mongol line.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page358" title="358"/>
<p class="para-p">It was surely this Serpent that had dealt the death blow to the Sky Lantern. Hawks assailed it now. Two were flying back from the western edge of the battle line. Two more arced up from behind the Sixth Legion, newly launched. Arrows flew. Much quicker than the Serpent, the Hawks overhauled it and pumped arrows into it at almost point-blank range.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Maya craft shivered in the air as the arrows hit. Much more gently than the Lantern, it began to sink earthward. Two of its pilots hung limp in their straps, and without their help the rest of its crew could not possibly control it. Even now the Hawk pilots were still shooting arrows, taking their revenge. It would soon be over.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus brought his attention back to earth. The Mongol heavies had disengaged from the Roman front line and were cantering back across the grass. Once they were out of the way, the Mongol horse archers again brought their terrible bows to bear, firing into his ranks.</p>
<p class="para-p">Shit. Too much was happening at once. “We must change out the front line!” Marcellinus snapped to Sollonius, but Appius Gallus was already on it. The third and fourth lines were stepping forward with scuta raised to allow their fellows to rotate out. The next Mongol assault would face fresh legionaries. Those men who had already fought could rest.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus would get no more signals from his doomed Sky Lantern, and it would take a while to launch another. “How do the Second and Third fare?” he asked Aulus.</p>
<p class="para-p">“How the hell would I know?” said his adjutant.</p>
<p class="para-p">Ignoring the insubordination—time might be of the essence—Marcellinus looked back along the ranks of his army. The cohorts of First Tribune Aurelius Dizala had given little ground in the face of the Shappan infantry assault. The Mongol heavies were wheeling and would soon be back in another terrifying attack.</p>
<p class="para-p">He coughed as a wave of black smoke blew past. To Takoda, he said: “What’s happening with Aelfric on the left? Find out.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I will.” Takoda spurred his horse and rode off.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page359" title="359"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had not consciously heard a trumpet signal for some time. Then again, he’d been busy. “Call for news,” he told Aulus. “Learn what you can. Then come tell me. I’m going to the center front with Sollonius. And bad-mouth me one more time, soldier, and I’ll leave you bleeding in the dirt.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Aulus was panting. Beneath his bluster, his adjutant was terrified. Now he gulped. “Sir, yes, sir. Sorry, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Better.” Marcellinus nodded curtly, applied his heels to his horse’s flanks, and galloped along the rear of the Second and Third, looking for Aurelius Dizala.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The Cahokian force under Tahtay and Wahchintonka had also come under heavy assault from the Mongol cavalry and had been pushed back. Now, thanks to defensive interference from the Ninth Syrian and a heroic and costly countercharge from Mahkah’s Second Cahokian, they were advancing again to rejoin the Sixth. And nobody had heard anything from Hanska or her warriors since the battle had begun.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Juno,” Marcellinus said to Enopay, who had brought him this news and other dispatches as he and Sollonius stood dismounted at the rear of the Third Cohort. Battlefield confusion was growing. Marcellinus had tried to get to the front lines, where Dizala’s cohorts were still grinding against the Shappa Ta’atani in the slog of the melee, but the press of soldiers was too great. Instead, he had diverted to give encouragement to the centurions of Statius Paulinus’s Fourth Cohort, who had faced an onslaught from the Mongol cavalry of the same force and fury that the First had experienced, but at the cost of many more men. They had been pushed back fifty feet but had held there, largely because the Fifth was behind them and they couldn’t retreat any farther. Bodies, Roman and Mongol, littered the battlefield in front of their line.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols had dropped back to mount fresh horses and regroup and were returning to formation, preparing to move in again. “You know what you face,” Marcellinus had concluded to the Fourth. “Set more spears. Farther forward. Pull <em class="char-i">their</em> spears, yank the verpa off their horses. But watch out for the barbs on those spears.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page360" title="360"/>
<p class="para-p">“Sir, yes, sir,” said the centurions.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus saluted them. “Give them hell. Make them bleed. Show these bastards how Roma can fight.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The men cheered him, which at least showed they still had animus, battle spirit. Marcellinus had nodded as if it were his due, as a commander must, and then had seen Enopay running nimbly through the Ninth Cohort. Enopay had waved the hand-talk for <em class="char-i">news</em> just as soon as he had seen Marcellinus and was now giving him that news, for what it was worth.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Also, they shot down our Sky Lantern.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I saw that,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Do we launch another?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus surely wanted to. Only a Sky Lantern could tell him what was going on farther away on the battlefield. “Did Chogan live?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, but he is hurt. Broken leg, broken arm.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus breathed a huge sigh of relief. “Good. All right. Ask Chogan and Sintikala, or whoever’s in charge of Raven and Hawk at the moment, whether we can spare Hawks to stay close and protect the Sky Lanterns next time a Serpent or Firebird comes from the enemy—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Never mind.” Enopay pointed. A new Sky Lantern was already rising over the rear of Marcellinus’s army.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Talk to the Hawks anyway,” Marcellinus said. “And make sure we get every signal we can out of that Lantern before it gets blown out of the sky as well.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay’s eyes widened in alarm. “Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Had that sounded cold? Well, they were at war.</p>
<p class="para-p">A roar came from behind him. From the Shappa Ta’atani. Marcellinus turned. “Jove. I hate complicated battles.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I hate all of them,” Enopay said fervently. “Oh, here’s Napayshni.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Napayshni was running toward them as best he could, favoring his wounded leg. “Where the hell is your horse, Napayshni?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I sent it to Tahtay,” Napayshni panted. “The First Cahokian has rejoined.”</p>
<p class="para-p">And indeed, here came Tahtay himself, cantering along the rear of the Sixth Cohort, sitting astride Napayshni’s horse as stiffly as if he were carved from wood. Cahokia’s war chief was not a relaxed horseman, and Marcellinus sometimes marveled that he could persuade his steeds to move at all, since his discomfort and lack of confidence were so apparent to man and beast.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page361" title="361"/>
<p class="para-p">“Hotah.” Tahtay saluted. “You still live, at least. And Enopay, too.” His eyes looked haunted.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded impatiently. “Where is the First Cahokian?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“A mile distant.” Tahtay pointed.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hard or easy?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“An easy mile now. The turmae of your Syrians chased the Mongols away from us. We wanted to come to hand to hand with them, but they stayed at bow distance.” Tahtay spit. “Cowards.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus shook his head. “The First is fresh? You have not fought yet today?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Bows and arrows only; I told you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“How would you like to fight Shappa Ta’atani?”</p>
<p class="para-p">If it were possible, Tahtay’s face grew even grimmer. “Now?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, of course now.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked back at his front line. Aurelius Dizala and his centurions and optios had restored some order among his men but were still losing ground. Marcellinus glanced around. “Quickly, Tahtay. The Mongol heavies are about to charge again. I only have moments. Bring the First Cahokian and Wahchintonka’s auxiliaries through to fight the Shappans. Yes?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay looked forward and back, measuring distances. “So Mizipian kills Mizipian again?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Just as the Shappans killed Ocatani. Or have you forgotten?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I have forgotten nothing.” The war chief looked down at Marcellinus, his eyes troubled, and for a moment Marcellinus thought his young friend was going to say something else or even refuse the order.</p>
<p class="para-p">They did not have time for that. “Tahtay. Pull yourself together. Get moving.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Mongols charging, sir,” said Sollonius. “Lights flowing through the line of heavies as before. Praetor?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay blanched at the sight of the Mongol line bearing down on them. “Merda…I’ll bring the First.” He kicked ineffectually at his horse’s flanks and, when it did nothing, swore and jumped off it. “Keep your damned horse, Napayshni.” He sprinted away.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page362" title="362"/>
<p class="para-p">“Here we go, shit,” Sollonius said. “Arrows coming, shield up, shield <em class="char-i">up</em>!” He lunged forward, raising his shield in front of Marcellinus. “Here we go again—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Breach!” Marcellinus shouted, and stepped back smartly. The rear of the Third Cohort was bulging out toward them. The last ranks were being pushed back, and now they began to break.</p>
<p class="para-p">That meant that the front line was breaking, too.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Fuck,” Marcellinus said to Sollonius.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, sir,” his adjutant replied automatically.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus turned to Enopay. “Didn’t I order you to go talk to the Hawks?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Uh, yes. Sorry. I was worried about Tahtay. He seems…not himself.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus handed Enopay the reins of his horse. “Go. Take this back past the Ninth Cohort and <em class="char-i">stay there</em>.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay looked uncertainly up at the Thessalian. “Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sollonius, you’re with me.” Marcellinus strode toward the exploding rear of the Third Cohort.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Marcellinus was to learn later that the Shappa Ta’atani had literally taken a battering ram to the front of the Third Cohort. Having seen the rams used by the Sixth Ferrata in knocking down the gates of Ocatan, they had experimented with using the idea themselves.</p>
<p class="para-p">And then they had brought liquid flame, presumably of their own manufacture, and placed a liberal quantity of it on the front of their ram.</p>
<p class="para-p">They had slammed the front of the Roman line with a battering ram that had then burst into flame, searing the legionaries to either side of it. The shock had forced the Roman files apart. The Shappans had followed up with a credible impression of a Roman cuneus, the wedge or pig’s-head formation that had broken many a mob of barbarians in Roma’s past. And so, after a melee that had lasted nearly an hour with little advantage in ground and position, they had managed to shatter the Third Cohort.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page363" title="363"/>
<p class="para-sp">At last, here came the First Cahokian. Tahtay led them, jogging easily out front. Akecheta was running at the front left corner of the cohort as a good centurion should, but was panting visibly. His men were equipped with Roman breastplates, Roman armor, Roman helmets. Most carried their gladii to stop them from banging against their legs in their sheaths as they ran. Others wore their swords at their waists and carried clubs, short spears, axes.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was not about to object. Let each Cahokian wield the weapon he felt most comfortable with.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Form up!” he shouted to Tahtay and Akecheta even before they arrived. Akecheta began snapping out orders as Marcellinus turned to Furnius. “Have the Third Cohort prepare to break off and fall back in good order. I’m bringing the First Cahokian in to relieve them.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Furnius looked alarmed. “Bringing? No, sir. You stay back.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Ignoring that, Marcellinus continued. “Tell Dizala. But first make sure the First and Fourth Cohorts and everyone behind them continues to stand firm against the Mongol charge.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus badly needed to be in three places at once. But that wasn’t possible. For now, he would have to trust Appius Gallus and his tribunes. Ahead of him Aurelius Dizala had been in close affray for what? An hour?</p>
<p class="para-p">Someone touched his arm. “Hotah?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Soldiers were not supposed to lay hands on their commanding officers in the field. It was all Marcellinus could do to stop himself from shaking off Tahtay’s hand. “What?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay was looking past him with troubled eyes. Marcellinus glanced where the boy was staring, but it was just a battle, and a battle they had to get into very soon now—</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">Damn it.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">For all Tahtay’s newfound maturity, for all his keen sense in council with the Imperator and the Praetors, for all that he gave the impression of being a magnificent leader…today was still only Tahtay’s second large-scale battle.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page364" title="364"/>
<p class="para-p">And in his first he had been beaten to the ground, his leg smashed, almost crippled.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay’s grip on Marcellinus’s arm was strengthening, and Marcellinus recognized the look in his war chief’s eyes. Tahtay was losing his nerve.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">Futete.</em> After all this?</p>
<p class="para-p">He needed Kimimela here to stiffen Tahtay’s spine. Why hadn’t he thought of that? It would have been ten times better to have Kimimela whispering her strength and determination into Tahtay’s ear than to have her careering dangerously around above them in the skies.</p>
<p class="para-p">“We need to crush them, war chief,” Marcellinus said bluntly. “Twice now the Shappa Ta’atani have betrayed Cahokia. They have murdered Ocatani. And before that they would have murdered the First Cahokian on the river had we given them the chance. Is it not so?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of course,” Tahtay said, but his response was automatic. He was sweating hard, looking neither back at his men nor up at Marcellinus but longingly to where the Third Cohort was even now withdrawing in ranks and streaming past the First Cahokian.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Forward! Walk! Close order!” In the meantime, Akecheta had gotten the First aligned in ranks. Dustu was in the first line along with many other warriors Marcellinus had fought alongside.</p>
<p class="para-p">For more reasons than Marcellinus had time to count, they needed to crush the Shappa Ta’atani. They were a dangerous distraction, forcing his attention away from the Mongols. The Sixth Ironclads were fully taxed in resisting the Mongol attacks. He needed the Cahokians to take care of the Shappans.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Tahtay? We have to smash them. Today-now. Head on. And you must lead the First. You are war chief of Cahokia.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="para-p">What could Marcellinus say? <em class="char-i">Don’t be afraid?</em></p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus leaned in. “Tahtay, I am not Kimimela. But she is right here, behind us both, and she is telling you not to be an idiot or she’ll smack your head. Now get your damned hand off my arm and lead your men into battle. Kill Shappa Ta’atani.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page365" title="365"/>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay took a step back, looked behind him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hating himself, Marcellinus grabbed the war chief by the shoulders and physically shook him. “Tahtay! Stand up and act like a man. Hurit is watching. And your father.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay turned slowly to stare at Marcellinus, his disbelief turning to shock and anger, and Marcellinus realized he had gone too far. “Tahtay, I—”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay lashed out, his fist swinging up in a ruthless uppercut. With his Roman helmet on, Marcellinus’s chin and nose were the only unprotected areas of his face.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus barely reacted quickly enough. Tahtay’s fist struck his cheek rather than his chin, knocking him sideways.</p>
<p class="para-p">Furnius swore, drew his gladius, leaped forward.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Stop!” Marcellinus flung up his arms to shove his adjutant away. “Halt! Drop back.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay’s eyes blazed. “Fuck you, Hotah. When we are done here, you are a dead man.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded. “As you say, war chief.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You use my father against me? And Hurit? And next you will say Mahkah and Mikasi? Who else? Is there anyone you will not use to get what you want, to make me fight your Roman war?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s mouth went dry. “Mahkah?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, Mahkah, who with Hanska and Takoda saved us from the Iroqua. Who stood over us both and took wounds for us. Do not pretend you did not know.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Tahtay.” Marcellinus seized the war chief again. “What the hell happened to Mahkah?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Enopay did not tell you?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Tahtay…”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We were assaulted by Mongols. The Ninth Syrian and the Second Cahokian came in to help us, with the Second trying to be stalwart and courageous, to keep up with your Romans. Mahkah coming in between the Mongols and me, Dustu, Akecheta, his other brothers. He fell, Hotah. He is dead, destroyed. Mahkah is dead. Are you happy now? You and your great war and your great Romans?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page366" title="366"/>
<p class="para-p">“Tahtay.” Dustu had seen what was going on and come striding back. “The Wanageeska is not your enemy. Come. Lead us. We need you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay blinked and looked up at Marcellinus again. The weight did not drop from his shoulders as it did when Kimimela spoke, but his eyes had cleared just a little. Perhaps his anger had helped. “Later, Hotah. We will talk more.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded curtly. Tahtay stepped away.</p>
<p class="para-p">Mahkah was dead?</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">Damn it.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">But they were at war. Many more lives were at stake. Marcellinus had lost men before, and he would lose more today. For now he needed to harden his heart. Later there would be time to grieve.</p>
<p class="para-p">In front of him, the melee had ceased. The Third Cohort were streaming past them in two groups. The Shappans had stepped away to breathe and form up again. They knew better than to spill into a gap between two columns of Romans, and they, too, must have welcomed the respite. Tired and wounded warriors limped back from the Shappan front line. Newer, fresher warriors came forward to take their places. Among them Marcellinus recognized some of the clan chiefs he had feasted with on the Shappan Temple Mound during the Green Corn Festival. There were the chiefs of Beaver and Deer, and off to the side, bent forward and winded, was the young chief of the Snake clan.</p>
<p class="para-p">Bodies lay in the area between the two armies. Romans were dragging their dead back, and after a pause the Shappans did likewise.</p>
<p class="para-p">From his left and right he felt the shock and heard the furor as the Mongol heavies again slammed into the Roman front line. Again came the crackle of small explosions from Jin salt weapons. “Great Jove…”</p>
<p class="para-p">He tried to put it out of his mind. One fight at a time.</p>
<p class="para-p">And then the sound of mounted warfare retreated from his consciousness, for Son of the Sun had stepped forward into the gap between the two armies.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page367" title="367"/>
<p class="para-p">Suddenly Marcellinus felt a rage of a strength that startled him, coupled with a wave of fear.</p>
<p class="para-p">The combination rocked him. For all his most formidable opponents—the Huron at the Battle for Cahokia, Avenaka on the Great Mound just after his murder of Great Sun Man, and Son of the Sun himself at their last face-to-face meeting on the banks of the Mizipi—Marcellinus had felt a wariness and a respect. This sudden fear was a new thing, and it shook him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Had this land changed him? Had he gained family and community at the cost of his courage in battle?</p>
<p class="para-p">If so, he might be about to lose all of it. And die with Tahtay’s hatred uppermost in his mind.</p>
<p class="para-p">If only Tahtay hadn’t told him about Mahkah’s death. Marcellinus would give anything not to have that appalling realization in his mind, distracting him from the here and now.</p>
<p class="para-p">An explosion came from far to his left. Another grenade of that damned Jin salt. Legionaries howled in pain. White smoke wafted over the battle line, but it did not buckle. Good men. Brave men.</p>
<p class="para-p">Son of the Sun was marshaling his front line, keeping a wary eye on the First Cahokian, where Akecheta and Tahtay were doing the same thing. The Cahokian and Shappan forces stood a scant twenty yards apart. Warriors whooped, preparing themselves to fight. Some Shappans held bows, although once the fray began again, they’d get off just a single arrow before having to drop the weapon and bring up a club or an ax.</p>
<p class="para-p">The two Hesperian armies looked well matched. Some Shappans wore the Roman breastplates and greaves that they had been given by the Sixth Ferrata to help them take Ocatan. Others wore the traditional Hesperian wooden or matting armor.</p>
<p class="para-p">Not one wore a helmet. Perhaps the Shappans considered them unmanly. It was a choice they might regret. Also, none carried Roman shields or weapons, clearly preferring the clubs and axes of their heritage. The Shappans as a nation wore less war paint than did the Cahokians; instead their faces bore more tattoos and vicious-looking scarifications. Some looked horrific, like patched-up human beings from a nightmare.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page368" title="368"/>
<p class="para-p">By comparison, the First Cahokian was neat and orderly in its use of Roman weapons and helmets. But if anything, their uniformity made them look odd, un-Hesperian, almost effete compared with the Shappa Ta’atani.</p>
<p class="para-p">Son of the Sun was a large man and heavyset, but today he appeared a giant. He wore wooden chest armor and over it the copper gorget of his office. In his right hand he held a mace, not of ceremonial chert but a longer, heavier, and more vicious battle weapon of hard wood with a large rounded rock set into its business end. His arms and legs were bare, showing off his hard musculature in addition to a daunting array of tattoos and scarifications. And as Marcellinus looked along the rallying ranks of the First Cahokian, Son of the Sun finally turned and caught sight of him.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Shappan war chief’s mouth cracked open into a broad, manic smile. He took a single step forward. Behind him, his men were lined up and ready.</p>
<p class="para-p">With a new shock, Marcellinus saw that his gladius hung from the chief’s waist, Marcellinus’s gladius with the ornate hilt from his campaign against the Khwarezmian Sultanate. The sword he had traded for Taianita on the riverbank outside Shappa Ta’atan.</p>
<p class="para-p">Holding his gaze, Son of the Sun drew it now, pointed it at Marcellinus, and waggled it. With his other hand he beckoned.</p>
<p class="para-p">The war chief’s meaning was clear. It was an invitation to single combat.</p>
<p class="para-p">Only a fraction of the First Cahokian had been with Marcellinus on the river. Akecheta had, of course, and now broke off from his haranguing of the First to look worriedly at Marcellinus. Tahtay was looking back and forth between them, perplexed, and Marcellinus remembered that Tahtay had never before seen the Shappan war chief.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus assumed a look of imperious contempt and raised his arms to make the hand-talk in the same phrases the chief had used to him on the riverbank: <em class="char-i">You want fight? Then we all fight.</em> Unable to resist, he followed this with an obscene gesture, and the First Cahokians who saw it broke out in that tense, aggressive laughter sometimes heard on fields of war. Out loud, Marcellinus shouted “First Cahokian! Let us slay the traitors of Shappa Ta’atan who murdered our brothers and sisters at Ocatan!”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page369" title="369"/>
<p class="para-p">The First Cahokian growled and braced. Tahtay nodded to Akecheta.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Maintain the line! Walk forward! Pila! Kill Shappa Ta’atani!” Akecheta bellowed. His commands were in Latin, as were almost all battle commands to the First Cahokian, and quizzical expressions briefly crossed the faces of some of the Shappa Ta’atani.</p>
<p class="para-p">Son of the Sun shrugged disdainfully, sheathed the gladius, and raised his mace. His voice boomed. “Kill Cahokians.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Cahokian front line took one step forward and cast their pila. At the same moment the Shappa Ta’atani threw their own spears and charged forward after them.</p>
<p class="para-p">The First Cahokian’s discipline held. They stepped up to face the Shappan charge, as cool as any Romans, thrusting their scuta forward. Those with thrusting spears or swords swung them, jabbing down over the top of the scuta at their enemies. Many of the Shappans were quick enough to avoid the thrusts and bring their clubs and axes down on Cahokian shields. The lines engaged, howling profanities.</p>
<p class="para-p">Despite his earlier moment of nerves Tahtay had thrown himself forward with the rest of the First. His sword met a Shappan tomahawk and smashed it away; the young man slashed downward almost immediately to cleave the wooden armor of his assailant.</p>
<p class="para-p">But that was all that Marcellinus saw, because Son of the Sun was barreling toward him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus raised his shield and broke into a run. If he was standing still when Son of the Sun impacted him, he might be bowled over. Beside and behind him other Cahokians surged, with Furnius drawing a blade and throwing himself forward, too.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page370" title="370"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus and Son of the Sun met at something like full running speed, Marcellinus ramming the boss of his shield into his opponent as hard as he could. At the same time Son of the Sun leaped, bringing down that gigantic stone mace.</p>
<p class="para-p">Son of the Sun’s stone club met the steel-lined rim of the shield, and the impact of his charge knocked Marcellinus backward. However, the momentum of the moving shield boss with Marcellinus’s weight behind it had smashed Son of the Sun’s arm back into his body and thrown him off balance as well. The Shappan war chief bounced away and crashed into one of his own warriors. He fell onto his right knee, not quite tumbling over entirely.</p>
<p class="para-p">The back of Marcellinus’s helmet banged against the breastplate of the man behind him as he fell. Flat on his back, he found himself glimpsing sky through a long fissure in his shield. Son of the Sun’s blow had bent the steel rim and cracked the wood of the shield from top to bottom. He swung it anyway, just as Son of the Sun pushed himself up and brought the mace down again.</p>
<p class="para-p">The shield exploded into a mess of wood and splinters. Marcellinus threw the remains aside and tried to roll away, but all around him were the legs of warriors. The two armies were fighting at close quarters, and he had almost no space to maneuver. Furnius was no longer beside him, and it was a mercy that Marcellinus had not already been kicked in the head.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was fear as much as dexterity that brought Marcellinus onto his feet again: fear of Son of the Sun’s speed, fear of being trampled in the scrimmage. Right beside him a Shappan and a Cahokian wrestled for possession of an ax, kicking and barging each other. Just six feet away Son of the Sun tried to swing, but two of his own warriors blundered into him, carrying him back.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Shappan front line drove forward again. Shappan warriors lunged. With his sword in his hand but no shield, Marcellinus shoved against them. All around was the reek of sweat, leather, smoke, and blood.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was almost absurd. Only a few feet separated Son of the Sun from Marcellinus, but neither could bring his weapons up to attack. Warriors of the First Cahokian were coming to defend and protect him. Furnius was yelling in Latin—“Let me through! Let me through!”—but the Cahokians could not have complied even if they had understood.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page371" title="371"/>
<p class="para-p">Similarly, Shappan warriors were attempting to get past Son of the Sun to attack Marcellinus. One brave almost succeeded in shoving through the throng, and Marcellinus recognized the chief of the Beaver clan, a man who had shown him no harm or disrespect in Shappa Ta’atan, one of the few clan chiefs there he had liked.</p>
<p class="para-p">With a strange howl the whole front line surged again like a tidal wave, carrying them with it. Marcellinus snatched his gladius back before he punctured the Cahokian brave who was pressed against him on his right, and then the swell of battle thrust him toward Son of the Sun again, jamming them up against each other without either managing to get in a good blow. Son of the Sun loomed over him, baring his teeth, and again Marcellinus felt that baffling terror.</p>
<p class="para-p">Fear was the killer. Fear would slow his brain and his arm and leave him dead in the dirt. Where was his battle ardor, that berserker fury that had sustained him in hot war throughout his life?</p>
<p class="para-p">His arms almost pinned, Marcellinus aimed a head butt. Son of the Sun, still grinning that insane battle grin, merely leaned away. And now the war chief thrust hard at the men who crowded him on either side, trying to free up space.</p>
<p class="para-p">Very well. Marcellinus could not fight the tide, and he could not wrestle a thousand men. And if he did not face his fear, he might as well be dead already.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus relaxed. Gravity, and the pressure of the bodies around him, dragged him down. The sky disappeared, and he saw only tunics and steel and heard the grunting of men shoving and punching each other as best they could.</p>
<p class="para-p">He was on the ground, and all around him was a snake pit of legs, moccasins, and mud. He clutched his sword close, trying to guard his head and keep his presence of mind.</p>
<p class="para-p">There. Son of the Sun’s gladius, Marcellinus’s old jeweled gladius that he knew so well, hung down to his left, only four men away from him.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page372" title="372"/>
<p class="para-p">He slashed at the legs between him and that gladius, careless of whether they belonged to friend or foe. A knee cracked into his helmet, momentarily dizzying him, and his anger began to build. He scrambled forward through the mud. In the process he shoved a brave over, and then another. The second landed on top of him in a crunch of pain and then rolled away. Marcellinus kept going, relentless and bloody-minded.</p>
<p class="para-p">He was buffeted sideways. He took another kick to the helmet. “Fuck!” Too many of those and it would be all over. His first instinct was to hamstring the offender, but no, he might be a Cahokian, even someone Marcellinus knew.</p>
<p class="para-p">Something else plinked against his helmet. It was his own gladius with the ornate hilt, still hanging from Son of the Sun’s belt. The war chief was directly above him. With no further thought Marcellinus rolled onto his back and thrust upward with the sword he held in his hand. Blood cascaded down over his face.</p>
<p class="para-p">The mace came thumping down into the mud by his head. Son of the Sun glared down at him from a sea of arms and heads and weapons with painfully bright streaks of white sky behind it, and mercifully Marcellinus kept his grip on his gladius as yet another warrior tripped over him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus stabbed upward into Son of the Sun’s abdomen. Rolled and stabbed again as the mace almost took his head off. Twisted and slashed deep into Son of the Sun’s thigh.</p>
<p class="para-p">Son of the Sun crashed down almost on top of him. The mace was no longer in his hands, but he would not have been able to swing it in such a confined space anyway. Instead the Shappan chief had drawn the jeweled gladius. He thrust it forward, and its blade skated off Marcellinus’s breastplate; Son of the Sun had been aiming for his guts but had had his blow knocked aside by the scrum of people above them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s head rang yet again as he was hit from behind. Moments later he was kicked in the back, but his rage was now all directed forward, and his pugio had appeared in his hand without him having any memory of drawing it.</p>
<p class="para-p">Son of the Sun thrust the gladius at Marcellinus’s throat. Marcellinus was in danger of being killed by his own weapon.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page373" title="373"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had nowhere to retreat to. He had to grab at the sword blade and push it away with his bare hand. Its sharp edge scored a bloody line along his palm and across the bony edge of his wrist, and again he barely noticed the pain.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus jabbed his pugio into Son of the Sun’s face, and the war chief roared as it sliced into his nose. He rammed his knee into Marcellinus’s gut. Marcellinus gasped, all the air driven out of him, but his fury made up for it. He twisted and thrust forward, and the point of his pugio slid into Son of the Sun’s windpipe.</p>
<p class="para-p">The war chief’s eyes went wide. He gurgled and punched at Marcellinus, who ducked his head just in time. Son of the Sun’s fist slammed into his helmet.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus wrenched sideways with what remained of his strength, and the pugio came free. He leaned in and stared into his enemy’s eyes for one second, two…and the hatred he saw there pulled his remaining reason from him, and he slashed again at the Shappan chief’s throat like a man possessed.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hands came down and grabbed at Marcellinus’s shoulders. Furnius had found him. Marcellinus resisted. He wanted to be sure that Son of the Sun was dead. But he certainly was or would be in moments; he lolled back, his face suddenly vacant, and when one of his own Shappans tripped and toppled over the war chief, he did not react at all.</p>
<p class="para-p">More hands came down. Friends or enemies? Aside from his bloody pugio the nearest weapon was his jeweled gladius, and that was out of arm’s reach. Marcellinus lunged for it anyway but could not get to it.</p>
<p class="para-p">He didn’t care. He didn’t want it back now anyway. What good were jewels to him? What good the memories?</p>
<p class="para-p">Instead, he grabbed the copper gorget from Son of the Sun’s chest. He tore it free and thrust it into his sleeve. Only then did Marcellinus allow himself to be dragged up and away from the body of the treacherous chieftain.</p></div></body></html>

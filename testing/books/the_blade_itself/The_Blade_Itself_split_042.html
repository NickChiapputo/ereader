<div id="filepos1240048" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Nobody’s Dog</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Why me?” West murmured to himself through gritted teeth, staring across the bridge towards the South Gate. That nonsense at the docks had taken him longer than expected, much longer, but then didn’t everything these days? It sometimes felt as if he was the only man in the Union seriously preparing for a war, and had to organise the entire business on his own, right down to counting the nails that would hold the horses’ shoes on. He was already late for his daily meeting with Marshal Burr, and knew there would be a hundred impossible things for him to get done today. There always were. To become involved in some pointless hold-up here at the very gate of the Agriont was all he needed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Why the hell must it be me?” His head was starting to hurt again. That all too familiar pulsing behind the eyes. Each day it seemed to come on earlier, and end up worse.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Because of the heat over the last few days, the guards had been permitted to come to duty without full armour. West reckoned that at least two of them were now regretting it. One was folded up on the ground near the gate, hands clasped between his legs, whimpering noisily. His sergeant stood stooped over next to him, blood running from his nose and pattering dark red drops on the stones of the bridge. The two other soldiers in the detail had their spears lowered, blades pointing towards a scrawny dark-skinned youth. Another southerner stood nearby, an old man with long grey hair, leaning against the handrail and watching the scene with an expression of profound resignation.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The youth glanced quickly over his shoulder and West felt a sting of surprise. A woman: black hair hacked off short and sticking off her head in a mess of greasy spikes. One sleeve was torn off round her shoulder and a long, sinewy brown arm stuck out, ending in a fist bunched tight around the grip of a curved knife. The blade shone, mirror bright and evilly sharp, the one and only thing about her that looked clean. There was a thin, grey scar all the way down the right side of her face, through her black eyebrow and across her scowling lips. It was her eyes, though, which truly caught West off guard: slightly slanted, narrowed with the deepest hostility and suspicion, and yellow. He had seen all kinds of Kantics in his time, while he was fighting in Gurkhul, in the war, but he never saw eyes like that before. Deep, rich, golden yellow, like…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Piss. That was the smell, as he came closer. Piss, and dirt, and a lot of old, sour sweat. He remembered that from the war alright, the stink of men who had not washed in a very long time. West fought the compulsion to wrinkle up his nose and breathe through his mouth as he approached, and the urge to circle out wide and keep his distance from that glittering blade. You have to show no fear if you’re to calm a dangerous situation, however much you might be feeling. In his experience, if you could seem to be in control, you were more than halfway to being there.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What the hell is going on here?” he growled at the bloody-faced sergeant. He had no need at all to feign annoyance, he was getting later and angrier by the second.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“These stinking beggars wanted to come into the Agriont, sir! I tried to turn them away, of course, but they have letters!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Letters?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The strange old man tapped West on the shoulder, handed over a folded sheet of paper, slightly grubby round the edges. He read it, his frown growing steadily deeper. “This is a letter of transit signed by Lord Hoff himself. They must be admitted.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But not armed, sir! I said they couldn’t go in armed!” The sergeant held up an odd looking bow of dark wood in one hand, and a curved sword of the Gurkish design in the other. “It was enough of a struggle getting her to give these up, but when I tried to search her… this Gurkish bitch…” The woman hissed and took a quick step forward, and the sergeant and his two guards shuffled nervously back in a tight group.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Peace, Ferro,” sighed the old man in the Kantic tongue. “For God’s sake, peace.” The woman spat on the stones of the bridge and hissed some curse that West could not understand, weaving the blade back and forth in a way that suggested she knew how to use it, and was more than willing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Why me?” West mumbled under his breath. It was plain he was going nowhere until this difficulty was resolved. As if he didn’t have enough to worry about. He took a deep breath and did his best to put himself in the position of the stinking woman: a stranger, surrounded by strange-looking people speaking words she didn’t understand, brandishing spears and trying to search her. Probably she was even now thinking about how horrible West smelled. Disorientated and afraid, most likely, rather than dangerous. She did look very dangerous though, and not in the least afraid.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man certainly seemed the more reasonable of the two, so West turned to him first. “Are you two from Gurkhul?” he asked him in broken Kantic.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man turned his tired eyes on West. “No. There is more to the South than the Gurkish.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Kadir then? Taurish?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You know the South?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A little. I fought there, in the war.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man jerked his head at the woman, watching them suspiciously with her slanted yellow eyes. “She is from a place called Muntaz.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I never heard of it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Why would you have?” The old man shrugged his bony shoulders. “A small country, by the sea, far to the east of Shaffa, beyond the mountains. The Gurkish conquered it years ago, and its people were scattered or made slaves. Apparently she has been in a foul mood ever since.” The woman scowled over at them, keeping one eye on the soldiers.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, I come from much further south, beyond Kanta, beyond the desert, even beyond the Circle of the World. The land of my birth will not be on your maps, friend. Yulwei is my name.” He held out a long, black hand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Collem West.” The woman watched them warily as they shook hands.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“This one is called West, Ferro! He fought against the Gurkish! Will that make you trust him?” Yulwei didn’t sound very hopeful, and indeed the woman’s shoulders were still as hunched and bristling as ever, her grip on the knife no less tight. One of the soldiers chose that unfortunate moment to take a step forward, jabbing at the air with his spear, and the woman snarled and spat again, shouting more unintelligible curses.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s enough!” West heard himself roaring at the guard. “Put your fucking spears up!” They blinked at him, shocked, and he fought to bring his voice back under control. “I don’t think this is a full-scale invasion, do you? Put them up!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Reluctantly the spearpoints drifted away from the woman. West stepped firmly towards her, keeping his eyes fixed on hers with all the authority he could muster. Show no fear, he thought to himself, but his heart was thumping. He held out his open palm, almost close enough to touch her.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The knife,” said West sharply in his bad Kantic. “Please. You will not be harmed, you have my word.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The woman stared at him with those slanted, beady yellow eyes, then at the guards with the spears, then back to him. She took plenty of time over it. West stood there, mouth dry, head still thumping, getting later and later, sweating under his uniform in the hot sun, trying to ignore the woman’s smell. Time passed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“God’s teeth, Ferro!” snapped the old man suddenly. “I am old! Take pity on me! I may only have a few years left! Give the man the knife, before I die!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ssssss,” she hissed, curling her lip. For a dizzy, stretched-out moment the knife went up, then the hilt slapped down into West’s palm. He allowed himself a dry swallow of relief. Right up until the last moment he had been almost sure she would give him the sharp end.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Thank you,” he said, a deal more calmly than he felt. He handed the knife to the sergeant. “Stow the weapons away and escort our guests into the Agriont, and if any harm comes to anyone, especially her, I’ll be holding you responsible, understand?” He glowered at the sergeant for a moment then stepped through the gate into the tunnel before anything else could go wrong, leaving the old man and the stinking woman behind him. His head was thumping harder even than before. Damn it he was late.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Why the hell me?” he grumbled to himself.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I am afraid the armouries are closed for the day,” sneered Major Vallimir, staring down his nose at West as though at a beggar whining for small change. “Our quotas are fulfilled, ahead of schedule, and we will not be lighting the forges again this week. Perhaps if you had arrived on time…” The pounding in West’s head was growing worse than ever. He forced himself to breathe slowly, and keep his voice calm and even. There was nothing to be gained by losing his temper. There was never anything to be gained by that.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I understand, Major,” said West patiently, “but there is a war on. Many of the levies we have received are scarcely armed, and Lord Marshal Burr has asked that the forges be lit, in order to provide equipment for them.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">This was not entirely true, but since joining the Marshal’s staff West had more or less given up on telling the whole truth to anyone. That was no way to get anything done. He now employed a mixture of wheedling, bluster, and outright lies, humble entreaties and veiled threats, and had become quite expert at judging which tactic would be most effective on what man.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Unfortunately, he had yet to strike the right chord with Major Vallimir, the Master of the King’s Armouries. Somehow, their being equal in rank made matters all the more difficult: he could not quite get away with bullying the man, but could not quite bring himself to beg.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Furthermore, in terms of social standing they were anything but equals. Vallimir was old nobility, from a powerful family, and arrogant beyond belief. He made Jezal dan Luthar seem a humble, selfless type, and his total lack of experience in the field only made matters worse: he behaved doubly like an ass in order to compensate. Instructions from West, though they might come from Marshal Burr himself, were as welcome as they would have been from a reeking swineherd.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Today was no exception. “This month’s quotas are fulfilled, </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Major West</span></span><span class="calibre3">,” Vallimir managed to put a sneering emphasis into the name, “and so the forges are closed. That is all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And this is what you would have me tell the Lord Marshal?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The arming of levies is the responsibility of those lords that provide them,” he recited primly. “</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I</span></span><span class="calibre3"> cannot be blamed if </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">they</span></span><span class="calibre3"> fall short on </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">their</span></span><span class="calibre3"> obligations. It is simply not our problem, </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Major West</span></span><span class="calibre3">, and you may tell </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">that</span></span><span class="calibre3"> to the Lord Marshal.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">This was always the way of it. Back and forth: from Burr’s offices to the various commissary departments, to the commanders of companies, of battalions, of regiments, to the stores scattered around the Agriont and the city, to the armouries, the barracks, the stables, to the docks where the soldiers and their equipment would begin to embark in just a few short days, to other departments and back to where he began, with miles walked and nothing done. Each night he would drop into bed like a stone, only to start up a few hours later with it all to do again.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">As commander of a battalion his trade had been to fight the enemy with steel. As a staff officer, it seemed, his role was to fight his own side with paper, more secretary than soldier. He felt like a man trying to push a huge stone up a hill. Straining and straining, getting nowhere, but unable to stop pushing in case the rock should fall and crush him. Meanwhile, arrogant bastards who were in just the same danger lazed on the slopes beside him saying, “Well, it’s not my rock.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He understood now why, during the war in Gurkhul, there had sometimes not been enough food for the men to eat, or clothes for them to wear, or wagons to draw the supplies with, or horses to draw the wagons, or all manner of other things that were deeply necessary and easily anticipated.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West would be damned before that happened because of some oversight of his. And he would certainly be damned if he would see men die for want of a weapon to fight with. He tried yet again to calm himself, but each time his head hurt more, and his voice was cracking with the effort. “And what if we find ourselves mired in Angland with a crowd of half-clothed, unarmed peasants to provide for, what then, Major Vallimir? Whose problem will it be? Not yours, I dare say! You’ll still be here, with your cold forges for company!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West knew as soon as he said it that he had gone too far: the man positively bristled. “How dare you, sir! Are you questioning my personal honour? My family goes back nine generations in the King’s Own!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West rubbed his eyes, not knowing whether he wanted to laugh or cry. “I have no doubts as to your courage, I assure you, that was not my meaning at all.” He tried to put himself in Vallimir’s position. He did not really know the pressures the man was under: probably he would rather be in command of soldiers than smiths, probably… it was no use. The man was a shit, and West hated him. “This is not a question of your honour, Major, or that of your family. This is a question of our being fit for war!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Vallimir’s eyes had turned deadly cold. “Just who do you think you’re talking to, you dirty commoner? All the influence you have you owe to Burr, and who is he but an oaf from the provinces, risen to his rank by fortune alone?” West blinked. He guessed what they said about him behind his back of course, but it was another thing to hear it to his face. “And when Burr is gone, what will become of you? Eh? Where will you be without him to hide behind? You’ve no blood, no family!” Vallimir’s lips twisted in a cold sneer. “Apart from that </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">sister</span></span><span class="calibre3"> of yours of course, and from what I hear—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West found himself moving forward, fast. “What?” he snarled. “What was that?” His expression must have been dire indeed: he saw the colour draining from Vallimir’s face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I… I—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You think I need Burr to fight my battles, you fucking gutless worm?” Before he knew it he had moved again, and Vallimir stumbled back towards the wall, flinching sideways and raising one arm as if to ward off an expected blow. It was the most West could do to stop his hands from grabbing hold of the little bastard and shaking him until his head came off. His own skull was throbbing, pounding. He felt as though the pressure would pop his eyes right out of his head. He dragged in long, slow breaths through his nose, clenched his fists until they hurt. The anger slowly subsided, back below the point where it threatened to take sudden control of his body. It only pulsed now, squeezing at his chest.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“If you have something to say on the subject of my sister,” he whispered softly, “then you can say it. Say it now.” He let his left hand drop slowly to sit on the hilt of his sword. “And we can settle this outside the city walls.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Major Vallimir shrank back still further. “I heard nothing,” he whispered, “nothing at all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Nothing at all.” West looked down into his white face for a moment longer, then stepped away. “Now if you would be so good as to reopen the forges for me? We have a great deal of work to get through.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Vallimir blinked for a moment. “Of course. I will have them lit at once.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West turned on his heel and stalked off, knowing the man was glowering daggers at his back, knowing that he had made yet another bad situation worse. One more high-born enemy among the many. The really galling thing was that the man was right. Without Burr, he was as good as finished. He had no family apart from that </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">sister</span></span><span class="calibre3"> of his. Damn it, his head hurt. “Why me?” he hissed to himself. “Why?”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was still a lot to do today, enough for a whole day’s work on its own, but West could take no more. His head hurt so badly that he could hardly see. He had to lie down in the dark, with a wet cloth over his face, if only for an hour, if only for a minute. He fumbled in his pocket for his key, his other hand clamped over his aching eyes, his teeth locked together. Then he heard a sound on the other side of the door. A faint clink of glass. Ardee.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No,” he hissed to himself. Not now! Why the hell had he ever given her a key? Cursing softly, he raised his fist to knock. Knocking on his own door, that was where he was now. His fist never made it to the wood. A most unpleasant image began to form in the back of his mind. Ardee and Luthar, naked and sweaty, writhing around on his carpet. He turned his key swiftly in the lock and shoved the door open.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She was standing by the window, alone and, he was relieved to see, fully dressed. He was less pleased to see her filling a glass right to the brim from the decanter though. She raised an eyebrow at him as he burst through the door.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, it’s you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who the hell else would it be?” snapped West. “These are my rooms, aren’t they?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Somebody’s not in the best of moods this morning.” A bit of wine slopped over the rim of her glass and onto the table. She wiped it up with her hand and sucked her fingers, then took a long swig from the glass for good measure. Her every movement niggled at him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West grimaced and shoved the door shut. “Do you have to drink so much?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I understand that a young lady should have a beneficial pastime.” Her words were careless, as usual, but even through his headache West could tell there was something strange going on. She kept glancing towards the desk, then she was moving towards it. He got there first, snatched up a piece of paper from the top, one line written on it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What’s this?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Nothing! Give it me!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He held her away with one arm and read it:</span></p><p class="calibre2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The usual place, tomorrow night</span></span></p><p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">—</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A.</span></span></p><p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">West’s skin prickled with horror. “Nothing? Nothing?” He shook the letter under his sister’s nose. Ardee turned away from him, flicking her head as you might at a fly, saying nothing, but slurping noisily from her glass. West ground his teeth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It’s Luthar, isn’t it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I didn’t say so.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You didn’t have to.” The paper crumpled up into a tiny ball in his white-knuckled hand. He half turned towards the door, every muscle tensed and trembling. It was the most he could do to stop himself dashing out and throttling the little bastard right now, but he was just able to make himself think for a moment.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal had let him down, and badly, that ungrateful shit. But it was hardly that shocking—the man was an ass. You keep your wine in a paper bag you shouldn’t be too upset when it leaks. Besides, Jezal wasn’t the one writing the letters. What good would stepping on his neck do? There would always be more empty-headed young men in the world.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Just where are you going with this, Ardee?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She sat down on the settle and glared at him frostily over the rim of her glass. “With what, brother?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You know with what!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Aren’t we family? Can’t we be candid with each other? If you have something to say you can out and say it! Where do you think I’m going?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I think you’re going straight to shit, since you ask!” He squeezed his voice back down with the greatest of difficulty. “This business with Luthar has gone way too far. Letters? Letters? I warned him, but it seems he wasn’t the problem! What are you thinking? Are you thinking at all? It has to stop, before people start to talk!” He felt a suffocating tightness in his chest, took a deep breath, but his voice burst out anyway. “They’re damn well talking already! It stops now! Do you hear me?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I hear you,” she said carelessly, “but who cares what they think?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I care!” He nearly screamed it. “Do you know how hard I have to work? Do you think I’m a fool? You know what you’re about, Ardee!” Her face was turning sullen, but he forged on. “It’s not as though this is the first time! Must I remind you, your luck with men has not exactly been the best!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not with the men in my family, at least!” She was sitting bolt upright now, face tight and pale with anger. “And what would you know about my luck? We’ve hardly talked in ten years!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We’re talking now!” shouted West, flinging the crumpled bit of paper across the room. “Have you thought how this might turn out? What if you were to get him? Have you considered that? Would his family be charmed by the blushing bride, do you think? At best they’d never speak to you. At worst they’d cut you both off!” He pointed a shaking finger at the door. “Haven’t you noticed he’s a vain, arrogant swine! They all are! How would he manage, do you think, without his allowance? Without his friends in high places? He wouldn’t know where to begin! How could you be happy with each other?” His head was ready to split in half, but he ranted on. And what happens if, as is far more likely, you can’t get him? What then? You’d be finished, have you thought on that? You’ve come close enough before! And you’re supposed to be the clever one! You’re making a laughing-stock of yourself!” He almost choked on his rage. “Of both of us!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ardee gave a gasp. “Now we see it!” she nearly screamed at him. “No one cares a shit for me, but if </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">your</span></span><span class="calibre3"> reputation is in danger—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You fucking stupid bitch!” The decanter flew spinning across the room. It crashed against the wall not far from Ardee’s head, sending fragments of glass flying and wine running down the plaster. It made him more furious. “Why don’t you fucking listen?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was across the room in an instant. Ardee looked surprised, just for a moment, then there was a sharp click—his fist catching her in the face as she got up. She didn’t fall far. His hands caught her before she hit the ground, yanked her up then flung her back against the wall.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’ll be the end of us!” Her head smacked against the plaster—once, twice, three times. One hand grabbed hold of her neck.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Teeth bared. Body crushed her against the wall. A little snort in her throat as the fingers began to squeeze.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You selfish, useless… fucking… whore!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Hair was tangled across her face. He could only see a narrow slice of skin, the corner of a mouth, one dark eye.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The eye stared back at him. Painless. Fearless. Empty, flat, like a corpse.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Squeeze. Snort. Squeeze.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Squeeze…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West came to his senses with a sickening jolt. The fingers snapped open, he jerked the hand away. His sister stayed upright against the wall. He could hear her breathing. Short gasps. Or was that him? His head was splitting. The eye was still staring at him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He must have imagined it. Must have. Any second now he would wake up, the nightmare would be over. A dream. Then she pushed the hair out of her face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Her skin was candle wax, pasty white. The trickle of blood from her nose looked almost black against it. The pink marks stood out vivid on her neck. The marks the fingers made. His fingers. Real, then.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West’s stomach churned. His mouth opened but no sound came out. He looked at the blood on her lip, and he wanted to be sick. “Ardee…” He was so disgusted he half vomited as he said the word. He could taste the bile at the back of his mouth, but his voice wouldn’t stop gurgling away. “I’m sorry… I’m so sorry… Are you alright?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’ve had worse.” She reached up slowly and touched her lip with a finger-tip. The blood smeared out across her mouth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ardee…” One hand reached out to her, then he jerked it back, afraid of what it might do. “I’m sorry…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He was always sorry. Don’t you remember? He’d hold us and cry afterwards. Always sorry. But it never stopped him the next time. Have you forgotten?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West gagged, choked back vomit again. If she’d wept, and ranted, and beat him with her fists, it would have been easier to bear. Anything but this. He tried never to think about it, but he hadn’t forgotten. “No,” he whispered, “I remember.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Did you think he stopped when you left? He got worse. Only then I’d hide on my own. I used to dream that you’d come back, come back and save me. But when you did come back it wasn’t for long, and things weren’t the same between us, and you did nothing.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ardee… I didn’t know—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You knew, but you got away. It was easier to do nothing. To pretend. I understand, and do you know, I don’t even blame you. It was some kind of comfort, back then, to know you got away. The day he died was the happiest of my life.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He was our father—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh yes. My bad luck. Bad luck with men. I cried at the grave like a dutiful daughter. Cried and cried until the mourners feared for my reason. Then I lay in bed awake, until everyone was sleeping. I crept out of the house, I went back to the grave, I stood a while looking down… then I fucking pissed on it! I pulled up my shift, and I squatted down, and I pissed on him! And all the while I was thinking—I’ll be nobody’s dog any more!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She wiped the blood from her nose on the back of her hand. “You should have seen how happy I was when you sent for me! I read the letter over and over. The pathetic little dreams all came alive again. Hope, eh? What a fucking curse! Off to live with my brother. My protector. He’ll look out for me, he’ll help me. Now maybe </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I </span></span><span class="calibre3">can have a life! But I find you different than I remembered. All grown up. First you ignore me, then you lecture me, then you hit me, and now you’re sorry. Truly your father’s son!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He groaned. It was as if she was sticking a needle in him, right in his skull. Less than he deserved. She was right. He had failed her. Long before today. While he had been playing with swords and kissing the arses of people who despised him, she had been suffering. A little effort was all it would have taken, but he could never face it. Every minute he had spent with her he felt the guilt, like a rock in his gut, weighing him down, unbearable.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She stepped away from the wall. “Perhaps I’ll go and pay a call on Jezal. He may be the shallowest idiot in the whole city, but I don’t think he’d ever raise a hand to me, do you?” She pushed him out of the way and made for the door.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ardee!” he caught hold of her arm. “Please… Ardee… I’m sorry…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She stuck her tongue out, curled it into a tube, and blew bloody spit through it. It splattered softly down the front of his uniform. “That’s for your sorry, bastard.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The door banged shut in his face.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_42"></div></div></body>

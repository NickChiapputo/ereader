<div id="filepos1010290" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Her Kind Fight Everything</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Night. Cold. The salt wind was keen on the hilltop, and Ferro’s clothes were thin and ragged. She hugged her arms and hunched up her shoulders, staring sourly down towards the sea. Dagoska was a cloud of pinprick lights in the distance, huddled around the steep rock between the great, curving bay and the glistening ocean. Her eyes could make out the vague, tiny shapes of walls and towers, black against the dark sky, and the thin neck of dry earth that joined the city to the land. An island, almost. Between them and Dagoska there were fires. Camps around the roads. Many camps.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Dagoska,” whispered Yulwei, perched on a rock beside her. “A little splinter of the Union, stuck into Gurkhul like a thorn. A thorn in the Emperor’s pride.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh,” grunted Ferro, hunching her shoulders still further.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The city is watched. Many soldiers. More than ever. It might be difficult to deceive so many.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Perhaps we should go back,” she muttered hopefully.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man ignored her. “</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">They</span></span><span class="calibre3"> are here as well. More than one.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Eaters?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I must go closer. Find a way in. Wait here for me.” He paused, waiting for her to reply. “You will wait?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Alright!” she hissed, “alright, I’ll wait!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei slipped off his rock and away down the slope, padding across the soft earth, almost invisible in the inky blackness. When the sound of his jingling bangles had faded into the night, she turned away from the city, took a deep breath, and scurried down the slope southwards, back into Gurkhul.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Now Ferro could run. Fast as the wind, hours at a stretch. She’d spent a lot of time running. When she made it to the base of the hill she ran, feet flying across the open ground, breath coming quick and fierce. She heard water beyond, slid down a bank and splashed into the shallows of a slow moving river. She floundered on, knee-deep in the cold water.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Let the old bastard track me through this, she thought.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">After a while she made a bundle of her weapons and held them above her head as she swam across, forcing against the current with one arm. She flapped out on the other side and ran on along the bank, wiping the water from her dripping face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Time passed slowly and light began to creep into the sky. Morning was coming. The river babbled beside her, her sandals beating out a rapid rhythm in the stubbly grass. She left the river behind, running on across the flat landscape, turning now from black to grey. A clump of scrubby trees loomed up.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She crashed between the trunks and slithered down into the bushes, her breath rasping. She shivered in the half-light, heart pounding in her chest. It was silent beyond the trees. Good. She reached inside her clothes and pulled out some bread and a strip of meat, soggy from the swim but still edible. She smiled. She had been keeping half of everything that Yulwei gave her for the last few days.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Stupid old bastard,” she chuckled to herself between choking mouthfuls, “thought he could get the better of Ferro Maljinn, did he?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Damn she was thirsty. No help for that now, she could find water later. She was tired though, very tired. Even Ferro got tired. She would rest here for a moment, just a moment. Get the strength back in the legs, then on, on to… she twitched, annoyed. She could think about the where later. Wherever was best for vengeance. Yes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She crawled through the bushes, sat back against one of the trees. Her eyes closed slowly, by themselves. Just rest for a moment now. Vengeance later.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Stupid old bastard,” she muttered. Her head dropped sideways.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Brother!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro woke with a start, head knocking against the tree. It was light, too light. Another bright, hot day. How long had she been sleeping? “Brother!” A woman’s voice, not far off. “Where are you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Over here!” Ferro froze, every muscle tensing. A man’s voice, deep and strong. And close. She heard horse’s hooves, moving slowly, several horses, and near.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What are you doing, brother?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“She’s close!” shouted the man again. Ferro’s throat tightened. “I can smell her!” Ferro felt in the bushes for her weapons, shoved the sword and the knife through her belt, tucked the other knife up her one, torn sleeve. “I can taste her, sister! She’s very close!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But where?” The woman’s voice drew nearer. “Do you think she can hear us?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Perhaps she can!” laughed the man. “Are you there, Maljinn?” She threw her quiver over her shoulder and snatched up her bow. “We are waiting…” he sang, getting closer still, just beyond the trees now. “Come out, Maljinn, come out and greet us…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She bolted away, crashing through the bushes, sprinting across the open ground with desperate speed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There she is!” cried the woman from behind. “Look at her go!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Get her, then!” shouted the man.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The scrubby grassland stretched away unbroken before her. Nowhere to run to. She span around with a snarl, nocking an arrow to her bow. Four horsemen were spurring towards her, Gurkish soldiers, sun glinting on their tall helmets and the cruel heads of their spears. Behind them, further back, were two other riders: a man and a woman. “Stop! In the name of the Emperor!” one of the horsemen shouted.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Fuck your Emperor!” Her arrow caught the first of the soldiers through his neck and he tumbled backwards from the saddle with a shocked gurgle, his spear flying out of his hand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good shot!” cried the woman. The second rider took an arrow in his chest. His breastplate slowed it, but it still went deep enough to kill. He screamed, dropping his sword in the grass, clutching at the shaft, rolling in the saddle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The third never even made a sound. He got one in the mouth, at no more than ten strides away. The point went right through his skull and knocked his helmet off, but by then the fourth was on her. She threw the bow to the ground and rolled away as the soldier thrust at her with his spear, then she pulled the sword from her belt, spitting on the grass.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Alive!” shouted the woman, nudging her horse lazily forwards. “We need her alive!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The soldier turned his snorting mount and urged it cautiously towards Ferro. He was a big man, with a thick growth of dark stubble on his jaw. “I hope you’ve made your peace with God, girl,” he said.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Fuck your God!” She scuttled out of the way, dodging, moving, staying close to the ground. The soldier jabbed at her with his spear, keeping her at a distance, his horse’s hooves pawing at the ground, kicking dust in Ferro’s face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Poke her!” she heard the woman shouting behind her.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, poke her!” cried her brother through his giggling. “But not too hard! We want her alive!” The soldier snarled as he spurred his horse forward. Ferro ducked and scrambled in front of its kicking legs. The spear point jabbed, cutting a gash in her arm. She swung the sword with all her strength.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The curved blade found the gap between the plates of the soldier’s armour, took his leg off just below the knee and opened a huge wound in the horse’s side. Man and beast screamed together, fell together to the ground. Dark blood bubbled out across the dirt.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“She got him!” The woman sounded mildly disappointed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Up, man!” laughed her brother, “up and at her! There’s still a chance!” The soldier thrashed on the ground. Ferro’s sword hacked into his face, putting a sharp end to his screams. Nearby the second rider was still in his saddle, face twisted, gasping his last breaths, hand clutched around the bloody shaft of her arrow. His horse put its head down and started nibbling at the dry grass by its hooves.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s all of them,” said the woman.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I know.” Her brother sighed deep. “Must one do everything oneself?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro glanced up at them as she pushed the bloody sword back through her belt. They were sitting carelessly on their horses not far off, the sun bright behind them, smiles on their cruel, handsome faces. They were dressed like lords, silk flapping round them in the breeze, heavy with jewellery, but neither one was armed. Ferro scrambled for her bow.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Be careful, brother,” said the woman, examining her fingernails. “She fights well.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Like a devil! But she is no match for me, sister, have no fear.” He sprang down from his saddle. “So then, Maljinn, shall we…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The arrow stuck him through the chest, deep through, with a hollow thud.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“…begin?” The shaft quivered, its point glittering behind him, dry and bloodless. He began to walk towards her. Her next arrow caught him through the shoulder, but he only came on faster, breaking into a run, bounding forward with enormous strides. She dropped the bow, fingers fumbling for the grip of her sword. Too slow. His outstretched arm caught her across the chest with terrible force, slamming her into the earth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, well done, brother!” The woman clapped her hands with delight. “Well done!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro rolled coughing in the dust. She saw the man watching her as she struggled to her feet, the sword clutched in both hands. She swung it at him, a great overhead arc. It bit deep into the earth. Somehow he had already danced aside. A foot came out of nowhere and sank into her stomach. She doubled over, powerless, the air driven from her body. Her fingers twitched, the sword was left stuck in the ground, her knees wobbled.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And now…” Something crunched into her nose. Her legs buckled and the ground hit her hard in the back. She rolled groggily to her knees, the world turning over around her. There was blood on her face. She blinked and shook her head, trying to stop the world from spinning. The man was moving towards her, tipping, blurry. He jerked her arrow out of his chest and tossed it away. There was no blood, just a little dust. Just dust, curling in the air.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">An Eater. He had to be.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro stumbled up, pulling the knife from her belt. She thrust at him, missed, thrust again, missed again. Her head was swimming. She screamed, slashing at him with all her might.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He caught her wrist in his hand. Their faces were less than a foot apart. His skin was perfect, smooth, like dark glass. He looked young, almost like a child, but his eyes were old. Hard eyes. He watched her—curious, amused, like a boy who found an interesting beetle. “She doesn’t give up, does she, sister?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Very fierce! The Prophet will be delighted with her!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The man sniffed at Ferro and wrinkled his nose. “Ugh. She’d better be washed first.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She butted him in the face. His head snapped back but he only giggled. He caught her round the throat with his free hand, shoved her out to arm’s length. She clawed at his face but his arm was too long, she couldn’t reach. He was prising her fingers from the handle of the knife. His grip was iron around her neck. She couldn’t breathe. She bared her teeth, struggling, snarling, thrashing. All in vain.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Alive, brother! We want her alive!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Alive,” murmured the man, “but not unharmed.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The woman giggled. Ferro’s feet left the ground, kicking at the air. She felt one of her fingers snap and the knife dropped to the grass. The hand gripped tighter round her neck, and she tore at it with broken nails. All in vain. The bright world began to turn dark.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro heard the woman laughing, far away. A face swam out of the darkness, a hand stroked Ferro’s cheek. The fingers were soft, warm, gentle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Be still, child,” whispered the woman. Her eyes were dark and deep. Ferro could feel her breath, hot and fragrant on her face. “You are hurt, you must rest. Be still now… sleep.” Ferro’s legs were heavy as lead. She kicked weakly, one last time, then her body sagged. Her heart beat slow…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Rest now.” Ferro’s eyelids began to droop, the woman’s beautiful face grew blurred.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Sleep.” Ferro bit down hard on her tongue, and her mouth turned salty.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Be still.” Ferro spat blood in the woman’s face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gah!” she shouted in disgust, wiping blood from her eyes. “She fights me!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Her kind fight everything,” came the man’s voice, just behind Ferro’s ear.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Now listen to me, whore!” hissed the woman, clutching Ferro’s jaw with steely fingers and yanking her face this way and that. “You are coming with us! With us! One way or another! You hear me?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“She goes nowhere.” Another voice, deep and mellow. It seemed familiar. Ferro blinked, shook her head groggily. The woman had turned, looking at an old man, not far away. Yulwei. His bangles jingled as he padded softly across the grass. “Are you alive, Ferro?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gugh,” she croaked.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The woman sneered at Yulwei. “Who are you, old bastard?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei sighed. “I am an old bastard.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Get you gone, dog!” shouted the man. “We come from the Prophet. From Khalul himself!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And she comes with us!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei looked sad. “I cannot change your minds?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They laughed together. “Fool!” cried the man. “Our minds never change!” He let go of one of Ferro’s arms, took a wary step forwards, dragging her with him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A shame,” said Yulwei, shaking his head. “I would have had you carry my respects to Khalul.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Prophet does not walk with the likes of you, beggar!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I might surprise you. We knew each other well, long ago.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I will give our master your respects then,” jeered the woman, “with the news of your recent death!” Ferro twisted her wrist, felt the knife drop into her palm.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, Khalul would enjoy that news, but he will not receive it yet. The two of you have cursed yourselves. You have broken the Second Law. You have eaten the flesh of men, and there must be a reckoning.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Old fool!” sneered the woman. “Your laws do not apply to us!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei slowly shook his head. “The word of Euz governs all. There can be no exceptions. Neither one of you will leave this place alive.” The air around the old man shimmered, twisted, blurred. The woman gave a gurgle and dropped suddenly to the earth, more than falling—melting, flopping, dark silk flapping around her collapsing body.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Sister!” The man let go of Ferro, sprang at Yulwei, arms outstretched. He got no further than a stride. He gave a sudden, shrill scream and dropped to his knees, clutching at his head. Ferro forced her stumbling feet forward, grabbed hold of his hair with her broken hand and drove the knife into his neck. Dust blew out into the wind. A fountain of dust. Flames flickered around his mouth, charring his lips black, licking burning hot at her fingers. She dropped on top of him, bearing him back onto the ground, choking, snorting. The blade opened up his stomach, scraped against his ribs, snapped off in his chest. Fire licked out. Fire and dust. She hacked at the body mindlessly with the broken knife, long after it had stopped moving.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She felt a hand on her shoulder. “He is dead, Ferro. They both are dead.” She saw it was true. The man lay on his back, staring up at the sky, face charred round his nose and mouth, dust blowing from the gaping wounds.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I killed him.” Her voice cracked and broken in her throat.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No, Ferro. I did that. They were young Eaters, weak and foolish. Still, you are lucky they wanted only to catch you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I am lucky,” she mumbled, dribbling bloody spit onto the Eater’s corpse. She dropped the broken knife, crawled away on all fours. The body of the woman lay next to her, if you could call it that. A shapeless, lumpy mass of flesh. She saw long hair, and an eye, and lips.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What did you do?” she croaked through her bloody mouth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I turned her bones to water. And burned him from the inside. Water for one, fire for the other. Whatever works, for their kind.” Ferro rolled over on the grass, looked up at the bright sky. She held her hand in front of her face, shook it. One of her fingers flopped back and forth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei’s face appeared above, staring down at her. “Does it hurt?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No,” she whispered, letting her arm drop back to the earth. “It never does.” She blinked up at Yulwei. “Why does it never hurt?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man frowned. “They will not stop seeking for you, Ferro. Do you see now, why you have to come with me?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She nodded slowly. The effort was immense. “I see,” she whispered. “I see…” The world grew dark again.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_36"></div></div></body>

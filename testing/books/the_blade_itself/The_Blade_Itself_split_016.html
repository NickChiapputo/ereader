<div id="filepos427629" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> A Road Between Two Dentists</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Past midnight, and it was dark in the Middleway. Dark and it smelled bad. It always smelled bad down by the docks: old salt water, rotten fish, tar and sweat and horse shit. In a few hours time this street would be thronging with noise and activity. Tradesmen shouting, labourers cursing under their loads, merchants hurrying to and fro, a hundred carts and wagons rumbling over the dirty cobbles. There would be an endless tide of people, thronging off the ships and thronging on, people from every part of the world, words shouted in every language under the sun. But at night it was still. Still and silent. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Silent as the grave, and even worse smelling.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It’s down here,” said Severard, strolling towards the shadowy mouth of a narrow alley, wedged in between two looming warehouses.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Did he give you much trouble?” asked Glokta as he shuffled painfully after.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not too much.” The Practical adjusted his mask, letting some air in behind. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Must get very clammy under there, all that breath and sweat. No wonder Practicals tend to have bad tempers.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “He gave Rews’ mattress some trouble, stabbed it all to bits. Then Frost knocked him on the head. Funny thing. When that boy knocks a man on the head, the trouble all goes out of him.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What about Rews?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Still alive.” The light from Severard’s lamp passed over a pile of putrid rubbish. Glokta heard rats squeaking in the darkness as they scurried away.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You know all the best neighbourhoods, don’t you Severard?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s what you pay me for, Inquisitor.” His dirty black boot squelched, heedless, into the stinking mush. Glokta limped gingerly around it, holding the hem of his coat up in his free hand. “I grew up round here,” continued the Practical. “Folk don’t ask questions.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Except for us.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">We always have questions.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Course.” Severard gave a muffled giggle. “We’re the Inquisition.” His lamp picked out a dented iron gate, the high wall above topped with rusty spikes. “This is it.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Indeed, and what an auspicious-looking address it is.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The gate evidently didn’t see much use, its brown hinges squealed in protest as the Practical unlocked it and heaved it open. Glokta stepped awkwardly over a puddle that had built up in a rut in the ground, cursing as his coat trailed in the foul water.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The hinges screamed again as Severard wrestled the heavy gate shut, forehead creasing with the effort, then he lifted the hood on his lantern, lighting up a wide ornamental courtyard, choked with rubble and weeds and broken wood.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And here we are,” said Severard.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It must once have been a magnificent building, in its way. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">How much would all those windows have cost? How much all that decorative stonework? Visitors must have been awed by its owners wealth, if not his good taste.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> But no more. The windows were blinded with rotting boards, the swirls of masonry were choked with moss and caked with bird droppings. The thin layer of green marble on the pillars was cracked and flaking, exposing the rotten plaster underneath. All was crumbled, broken and decayed. Fallen lumps of the façade were strewn everywhere, casting long shadows on the high walls of the yard. Half the head of a broken cherub stared mournfully up at Glokta as he limped past.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He had been expecting some dingy warehouse, some dank cellar near the water. “What is this place?” he asked, staring up at the rotting palace.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Some merchant built it, years ago.” Severard kicked a lump of broken sculpture out of his way and it clattered off into the darkness. “A rich man, very rich. Wanted to live near his warehouses and his wharves, keep one eye on business.” He strolled up the cracked and mossy steps to the huge, flaking front door. “He thought the idea might catch on, but how could it? Who’d want to live round here if they didn’t have to? Then he lost all his money, as merchants do. His creditors have had trouble finding a buyer.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta stared at a broken fountain, leaning at an angle and half filled with stagnant water. “Hardly surprising.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Severard’s lamp barely lit the cavernous space of the entrance lull. Two enormous, curved, slumping staircases loomed out of the gloom opposite them. A wide balcony ran around the walls at first floor level, but a great section of it had collapsed and crashed through the damp floorboards below, so that one of the stairways ended, amputated, hanging in the empty air. The damp floor was strewn with lumps of broken plaster, fallen roofing slates, shattered timbers and a spattering of grey bird droppings. The night sky peered in through several yawning holes in the roof. Glokta could hear the vague sound of pigeons cooing in amongst the shadowy rafters, and somewhere the slow dripping of water.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">What a place.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta stifled a smile. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">It reminds me of myself, in a way. We both were magnificent once, and we both have our best days far behind us.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It’s big enough, wouldn’t you say?” asked Severard, picking his way in amongst the rubble towards a yawning doorway under the broken staircase, his lamp casting strange, slanting shadows as he moved.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, I’d have thought so, unless we get more than a thousand prisoners at once.” Glokta shuffled after him, leaning heavily on his cane, worried about his footing on the slimy floor. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I’ll slip and fall right on my arse, right here in all this bird shit. That would be perfect.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The arch opened into a crumbling hall, rotten plaster falling away in sheets, showing the damp bricks beneath. Gloomy doorways passed by on either side. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The sort of place that would make a man nervous, if he was prone to nervousness. He might imagine unpleasant things in these chambers, just beyond the lamp light, and horrible acts taking place in the darkness.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He looked up at Severard, ambling jauntily along in front, tuneless whistling vaguely audible from behind his mask, and frowned. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But we are not prone to nervousness. Perhaps we are the unpleasant things. Perhaps the acts are ours.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“How big is this place?” asked Glokta as he hobbled along.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Thirty-five rooms, not counting the servant’s quarters.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A palace. How the hell did you find it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I used to sleep here, some nights. After my mother died. I found a way in. The roof was still mostly on back then, and it was a dry place to sleep. Dry and safe. More or less.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Ah, what a hard life it’s been. Thug and torturer is a real step up for you, isn’t it? Every man has his excuses, and the more vile the man becomes, the more touching the story has to be. What is my story now, I wonder?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ever resourceful, eh, Severard?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s what you pay me for, Inquisitor.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They passed into a wide space: a drawing room, a study, a ball-room even, it was big enough. Once beautiful panels were sagging from the walls, covered in mould and flaking gilt paint. Severard moved over to one, still attached, and pushed it firmly at one side. There was a soft click as it swung open, revealing a dark archway beyond. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A hidden door? How delightful. How sinister. How very appropriate.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“This place is as full of surprises as you are,” said Glokta, limping painfully towards the opening.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And you wouldn’t believe the price I got.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We bought this?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh no. I did. With Rews’ money. And now I’m renting it to you.” Severard’s eyes sparkled in the lamplight. “It’s a gold mine!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hah!” laughed Glokta, as he shuffled carefully down the steps. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">All this, and a head for business too. Perhaps I’ll be working for Arch Lector Severard one of these days. Stranger things have happened.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta’s shadow loomed out ahead of him into the darkness as he laboured crab-like down the steps, his right hand feeling out the gaps between the rough stone blocks to lend him some support.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The cellars go on for miles,” muttered Severard from behind. “We have our own private access to the canals, and to the sewers too, if you’re interested in sewers.” They passed a dark opening on their left, then another on their right, always going slowly downwards. “Frost tells me you can get all the way from here to the Agriont, without once coming up for air.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That could be useful.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’d say so, if you can stand the smell.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Severard’s lamp found a heavy door with a small, barred opening. “Home again,” he said, and gave four quick knocks. A moment later Practical Frost’s masked face loomed abruptly out of the darkness at the little window. “Only us.” The albino’s eyes showed no sign of warmth or recognition. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But then they never do.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Heavy bolts slid back on the other side of the door, and it swung smoothly open.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a table and chair, and fresh torches on the walls, but they were unlit. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">It must have been pitch black in here until our little lamp arrived.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta looked over at the albino. “Have you just been sitting here in the dark?” The hulking Practical shrugged, and Glokta shook his head. “Sometimes I worry about you, Practical Frost, I really do.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He’s down here,” said Severard, ambling off down the hall, heels making clicking echoes on the stone flags of the floor. This must once have been a wine cellar: there were several barrel-vaulted chambers leading off to either side, sealed with heavy gratings.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Glokta!” Salem Rews’ fingers were gripped tightly round the bars, his face pressed up between them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta stopped in front of the cell and rested his throbbing leg. “Rews, how are you? I hardly expected to see you again so soon.” He had lost weight already, his skin was slack and pale, still marked with fading bruises. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">He does not look well, not well at all.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What’s happening, Glokta? Please, why am I here?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Well, where’s the harm?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “It seems the Arch Lector still has a use for you. He wants you to give evidence.” Glokta leaned towards the bars. “Before the Open Council,” he whispered.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Rews grew paler still. “Then what?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We’ll see.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Angland, Rews, Angland.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What if I refuse?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Refuse the Arch Lector?” Glokta chuckled. “No, no, no, Rews. You don’t want to do a thing like that.” He turned away and shuffled after Severard.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“For pity’s sake! It’s dark down here!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’ll get used to it!” Glokta called over his shoulder. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Amazing, what one can get used to.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The last of the chambers held their latest prisoner. Chained up to a bracket in the wall, naked and bagged of course. He was short and stocky, tending slightly to fat, with fresh grazes on his knees, no doubt from being flung into the rough stone cell.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So this is our killer, eh?” The man rolled himself up onto his knees when he heard Glokta’s voice, straining forward against his chains. A little blood had soaked through the front of the bag and dried there, making a brown stain on the canvas.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A very unsavoury character indeed,” said Severard. “Doesn’t look too fearsome now, though, does he?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They never do, once they’re brought to this. Where do we work?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Severard’s eyes smiled even more. “Oh, you’re going to like this, Inquisitor.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It’s a touch theatrical,” said Glokta, “but none the worse for that.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The room was large and circular with a domed ceiling, painted with a curious mural that ran all the way round the curved walls. The body of a man lay on the grass, bleeding from many wounds, with a forest behind him. Eleven other figures walked away, six on one side, five on the other, painted in profile, awkwardly posed, dressed in white but their features indistinct. They faced another man, arms stretched out, all in black and with a sea of colourfully daubed fire behind him. The harsh light from six bright lamps didn’t make the work look any better. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Hardly of the highest quality, more decoration than art, but the effect is quite striking, nonetheless.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No idea what it’s supposed to be,” said Severard.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Mather Ma’er,” mumbled Practical Frost.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course,” said Glokta, staring up at the dark figure on the wall, and the flames behind. “You should study your history, Practical Severard. This is the Master Maker, Kanedias.” He turned and pointed to the dying man on the opposite wall. “And this is great Juvens, whom he has killed.” He swept his hand over the figures in white. “And these are Juvens’ apprentices, the Magi, marching to avenge him.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Ghost stories, fit to scare children with.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What kind of man pays to have shit like this on the walls of his cellar?” asked Severard, shaking his head.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, this sort of thing was quite popular at one time. There’s a room painted like this in the palace. This is a copy, and a cheap one.” Glokta looked up at the shadowed face of Kanedias, staring grimly down into the room, and the bleeding corpse on the opposite wall. “Still, there’s something quite unsettling about it, isn’t there?” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Or there would be, if I gave a damn.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Blood, fire, death, vengeance. No idea why you’d want it in the cellar. Perhaps there was something dark about our friend the merchant.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There’s always something dark about a man with money,” said Severard. “Who are these two?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta frowned, peering forward. Two small, vague figures could be seen under the arms of the Maker, one on each side. “Who knows?” asked Glokta, “maybe they’re his Practicals.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Severard laughed. A vague exhalation of air even came from behind Frost’s mask, though his eyes showed no sign of amusement. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">My, my, he must be thoroughly tickled.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta shuffled toward the table in the centre of the room. Two chairs faced each other across the smooth, polished surface. One was a spare, hard affair of the sort you found in the cellars of the House of Questions, but the other was altogether more impressive, throne-like almost, with sweeping arms and a high back, upholstered in brown leather.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta placed his cane against the table and lowered himself carefully, back aching. “Oh, this is an excellent chair,” he breathed, sinking slowly back into the soft leather, stretching out his leg, throbbing from the long walk here. There was a slight resistance. He looked beneath the table. There was a matching footstool there.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta tipped his head back and laughed. “Oh this is fine! You shouldn’t have!” He settled his leg down on the stool with a comfortable sigh.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It was the least we could do,” said Severard, folding his arms and leaning against the wall next to the bleeding body of Juvens. “We did well from your friend Rews, very well. You’ve always seen us right, and we don’t forget that.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Unhhh,” said Frost, nodding his head.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You spoil me.” Glokta stroked the polished wood on the arm of the chair. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">My boys. Where would I be without you? Back home in bed with mother fussing over me, I suppose, wondering how she’ll ever find a nice girl to marry me now.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He glanced over the instruments on the table. His case was there, of course, and a few other things, well-used, but still highly serviceable. A pair of long-handled tongs particularly caught his eye. He glanced up at Severard. “Teeth?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Seemed a good place to start.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Fair enough.” Glokta licked at his own empty gums then cracked his knuckles, one by one. “Teeth, it is.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">As soon as the gag was off the assassin started screaming at them in Styrian, spitting and cursing, struggling pointlessly at his chains. Glokta didn’t understand a word of it. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But I think I catch the meaning, more or less. Something very offensive indeed, I imagine. Something about our mothers, and so on. But I am not easily offended. </span></span><span class="calibre3">He was a rough looking sort, face pockmarked with acne scars, nose broken more than once and bent out of shape. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">How disappointing. I was hoping the Mercers might have gone up-market on this occasion at least, but that’s merchants for you. Always looking for the bargain.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Practical Frost ended the torrent of unintelligible abuse by punching the man heavily in the stomach. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">That’ll take his breath away for a moment. Long enough to get the first word in.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Now then,” said Glokta, “we’ll have none of that nonsense here. We know you’re a professional, sent to blend in and do a job. You wouldn’t blend in too well if you couldn’t even speak the language, now would you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The prisoner had got his breath back. “Pox on all of you, you bastards!” he gasped.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Excellent! The common tongue will do nicely for our little chats. I have a feeling we may end up having several. Is there anything you would like to know about us before we begin? Or shall we get straight to it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The prisoner stared up suspiciously at the painted figure of the Master Maker, looming over Glokta’s head. “Where am I?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We’re just off the Middleway, down near the water.” Glokta winced as the muscles in his leg suddenly convulsed. He stretched it out cautiously, waiting until he heard the knee click before he carried on. “You know, the Middleway is one of the very arteries of the city, it runs straight through its heart, from the Agriont to the sea. It passes through many different districts, has all manner of notable buildings. Some of the most fashionable addresses in the whole city are just up the lane. To me though, it’s nothing but a road between two dentists.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The prisoner’s eyes narrowed, then darted over the instruments on the table. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But no more cursing. It seems the mention of dentistry has got his attention.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Up at the other end of the avenue,” and Glokta pointed roughly northwards, “in one of the most expensive parts of town, opposite the public gardens, in a beautiful white house in the very shadow of the Agriont, is the establishment of Master Farrad. You might have heard of him?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Get fucked!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta raised his eyebrows. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">If only.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “They say that Master Farrad is the finest dentist in the world. I believe he came from Gurkhul originally, but he escaped the tyranny of the Emperor to join us in the Union and make a better life for himself, saving our wealthiest citizens from the terrors of bad teeth. When I came back from my own little visit to the South, my family sent me to him, to see if there was anything he could do for me.” Glokta smiled wide, showing the assassin the nature of the problem. “Of course there wasn’t. The Emperor’s torturers saw to that. But he’s a damn fine dentist, everyone says so.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So what?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta let his smile fade. “Down at the other end of the Middleway, down near the sea, in amongst the filth and the scum and the slime of the docks, am I. The rents may be cheap hereabouts, but I feel confident that, once we have spent some time together, you will not think me any less talented than the esteemed Master Farrad. It is simply that my talents lie in a different direction. The good Master eases the pain of his patients, while I am a dentist…” and Glokta leaned slowly forward “…of a different sort.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The assassin laughed in his face. “Do you think you can scare me with a bag on the head and a nasty painting?” He looked round at Frost and Severard. “You crowd of freaks?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Do I think we scare you? The three of us?” Glokta allowed himself a chuckle at that. “Here you sit, alone, unarmed and thoroughly restrained. Who knows where you are but us, or cares to know? You have no hope of deliverance, or of escape. We’re all professionals here. I think you can guess what’s coming, more or less.” Glokta grinned a sickly grin. “Of course we scare you, don’t play the fool. You hide it well, I’ll admit, but that can’t last. The time will come, soon enough, when you’ll be begging to go back in the bag.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’ll get nothing from me,” growled the assassin, staring him straight in the eye. “Nothing.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Tough. A tough man. But it’s easy to act tough before the work begins. I should know.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta rubbed his leg gently. The blood was flowing nicely now, the pain almost gone. “We’ll keep it simple to begin with. Names, that’s all I want, for now. Just names. Why don’t we start with yours? At least you can’t tell us you don’t know the answer.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They waited. Severard and Frost stared down at the prisoner, the green eyes smiling, the pink ones not. Silence.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta sighed. “Right then.” Frost planted his fists on either side of the assassins jaw, started to squeeze until his teeth were forced apart. Severard shoved the ends of the tongs in between and forced his jaws open, much too wide for comfort. The assassin’s eyes bulged. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Hurts, doesn’t it? But that’s nothing, believe me.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Watch his tongue,” said Glokta, “we want him talking.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Don’t worry,” muttered Severard, peering into the assassin’s mouth. He ducked back suddenly. “Ugh! His breath smells like shit!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A shame, but I am hardly surprised. Clean living is rarely a priority for hired killers.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta got slowly to his feet, limped round the table. “Now then,” he murmured, one hand hovering over his instruments, “where to begin?” He picked up a mounted needle and craned forward, his other hand gripped tight around the top of his cane, probing carefully at the killer’s teeth. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Not a pretty set, to be sure. I do believe I’d rather have my teeth than his.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Dear me, these are in a terrible state. Rotten through and through. That’s why your breath stinks so badly. There’s no excuse for it, a man of your age.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Haah!” yelped the prisoner as Glokta touched a nerve. He tried to speak, but with the tongs in place he made less sense than Practical Frost.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Quiet now, you’ve had your chance to talk. Perhaps you’ll get another later, I haven’t decided.” Glokta put the needle back down on the table, shaking his head sadly. “Your teeth are a fucking disgrace. Revolting. I do declare, they’re just about falling out on their own. Do you know,” he said, as he took the little hammer and chisel from the table, “I do believe you’d be better off without them.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_16"></div></div></body>

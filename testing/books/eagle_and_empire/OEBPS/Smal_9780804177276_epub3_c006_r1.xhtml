<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">I</span>t was as much as they could do to get Kanuna to step aboard the <em class="char-i">Minerva</em>. It was not the quinquereme itself that the elder feared, although the warship seemed daunting even to Marcellinus. It was more the prospect of sharing it with more than a hundred horses and mules.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay, of course, was clambering around the decks with the gleeful expression that another boy might wear on walking into a golden palace and being told its glittering contents were his to keep. Enopay had adored the <em class="char-i">Concordia</em>, and that was merely a Norse dragon ship. The <em class="char-i">Minerva</em> was much more substantial, and Enopay had gone aboard shortly after dawn, well before the rest of the Cahokians, having begged the indulgence of the ship’s master. He had explored every nook and cranny and stepped off the galley only to help coax his grandfather up the gangplank.</p>
<p class="para-p">“And so there are two hundred and seventy men who row,” the boy said importantly. “In the lowest layer of the hull there are twenty-three men on each side, paddling backward with the lowest row of oars you see sticking out. There is then a middle layer of rowers and a top layer. On the middle layer sit fifty-six men on each side, two to an oar, for those oars are much larger. And the top is the same: fifty-six more men and twenty-eight more oars.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kanuna looked down doubtfully, noting the separation among the three ranks of oars. “There can be very little room in there. It must be even worse than being up here.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page81" title="81"/>
<p class="para-p">“Much worse,” Marcellinus said. “For down there all must row for hours at a time, and up here the air is fresh. Well,” he said, glancing at the mules, “somewhat more fresh.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The quinquereme seemed overloaded. Four turmae of cavalrymen and their mounts took up a lot of deck space, and it was a high deck. “It will not tip over?” Kanuna said anxiously.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of course not,” Enopay said with the scorn of the young.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Probably not,” Marcellinus amended. In fact, adding the expeditionary force to the oarsmen, the regular deck crew, and the marines of the Sixth Ferrata who would guard the vessel on its trip back east was stretching the <em class="char-i">Minerva</em> to capacity. The ship’s master would have to balance the boat carefully, and the masters of horse would have to take pains to ensure that the beasts stayed where they were put.</p>
<p class="para-p">For the moment he had more immediate worries. Once loading was completed and the galley was under way, Marcellinus arrived on the poop deck of the <em class="char-i">Minerva</em> to be greeted by none other than Calidius Verus, Praetor of the Sixth, the general who had led the storming and destruction of Ocatan.</p>
<p class="para-p">If Marcellinus was irritated by Lucius Agrippa’s insufferable attitude, that was nothing compared with his instant loathing for Praetor Calidius Verus. Portly and red-faced, Verus wore an air of being permanently nauseated by the “barbarians” around him. Marcellinus had difficulty remaining tactful even during the introductions. For his part, Verus made no reference to the lost 33rd Legion, Ocatan, or Marcellinus’s long sojourn in Nova Hesperia but greeted him in a strangely familiar way as if they were old friends who had been out of each other’s sight for only a short while.</p>
<p class="para-p">Once the initial pleasantries were over, with Marcellinus wearing his forced smile like a rictus, Verus clasped his hands behind him and strode forward. “As instructed, I have two more guides and interpreters for you in addition to your own Taianita. I believe you are used to your word slaves coming in threes?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page82" title="82"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus did not respond. It would not have occurred to him in recent years to refer to Tahtay, Kimimela, and Enopay as word slaves.</p>
<p class="para-p">Calidius Verus smiled thinly. “The first is an Iroqua youth who claims he once owed you his life.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s heart sank, his mouth dropping open at the same time. “<em class="char-i">Pezi</em> is here?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Verus nodded. “Truth be told, I begrudge his assignment to you. Young Pezi has been extremely helpful in our dealings with the Iroqua. He picked up his Latin wickedly fast, and his quick thinking a time or two has saved a great deal of bloodshed.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“If it was his blood at risk, then I am scarcely surprised.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Verus shrugged. “These redskins all place undue value on their own dirty hides. And Pezi is very candid about exposing the deceit of his people. Anyway, he speaks the jabber of the Handies, and so it appears I must yield him to you for the time being. Try not to damage him.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus bit his tongue and moved on. “Who else?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Verus pointed. “Her. The young pussycat standing by the rail with the stick up her rear end is the Chitimachan. It’s the only name she’ll answer to. No idea what her real name is and don’t much care. Turns out she was stolen from the People of the Hand as a youngster and forcibly married into the Chitimachans, who run the Market of the Mud. Then, to add insult to injury, her trader husband used to take her with him back and forth to the southwest. So she’s to be your guide.”</p>
<p class="para-p">There was certainly nothing wrong with the Chitimachan’s hearing; as soon as Verus spoke her name, the young Hesperian on the deck below turned to gaze up at Marcellinus, her expression dour. Nonetheless, she was attractive and slender, and Marcellinus was sure that the Chitimachan’s time among Romans had not gone easily for her.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Belongs to one of the oddest of these native pagan cults. Babbles in tongues at night when she sleeps, but don’t be alarmed: she translates fast and fluently by day. Knows the trail and the lingos of many of the tribes along the shore of the Mare Solis. If matters go awry and you have to come back along the coast, she knows the territory like the back of her…Well.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page83" title="83"/>
<p class="para-p">The Chitimachan was still staring at Marcellinus, unsmiling and severe. Her gaze seemed to bore deep into him, and yet again in Nova Hesperia, Marcellinus had the disconcerting impression that the Chitimachan knew much more about him than he did about her.</p>
<p class="para-p">He had expected to be guided by Norse or Roman scouts or perhaps a grizzled old Hesperian backwoodsman. To learn that their expedition was in the hands of a guide as young and daunting as the Chitimachan gave him pause.</p>
<p class="para-p">Verus was regarding him, perhaps amused by his silence. “Thank you,” Marcellinus said, stuck for something to say.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Gaius Marcellinus. Sir…” Verus suddenly looked somber. “By all accounts, you and I once had a friend in common. A friend who spoke of you so well that I almost feel that we are comrades in arms and that some of the peculiarities of your past few years must be forgiven you. My apologies, but I wonder if I might prevail upon you to open a wound that might be somewhat painful.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Praetor’s patrician manners and circuitous way of speaking were already grating on Marcellinus. He was happy indeed that he would have to endure Calidius Verus for only a few hundred miles of river travel and not the trek across the Grass that would follow it. He forced himself to concentrate. “Sorry, what wound?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I speak of your First Tribune, back when you had the honor of commanding the 33rd Hesperian Legion.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus blinked and raised his gaze to look back at the Great Mound, the Sky Lanterns above it, and the traces of the river bluffs visible beyond it to the east, now all falling behind them as the warship battled the Mizipi current upriver. “Ah. Corbulo. Of course.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Verus shuffled his feet. “Lucius Domitius Corbulo was a good man and an excellent officer. We served together in Germania, he and I, and a more courageous soldier or better dining companion I never had the pleasure of meeting.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Corbulo had many fine qualities,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“We served together. Bloodied our gladii in many a battle and wenched together in many dark alleyways afterward.” Verus stood shoulder to shoulder with Marcellinus now, gazing out over Cahokia but obviously seeing another time and place entirely. “We lost touch when he was sent east to Sindh. I had always planned to bring him on as my own First Tribune when the Sixth was redeployed to guard against the Mongol incursions, but you’d snapped him up for the Hesperian in the meantime, and who can blame you? I’m glad you had such a man by your side.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page84" title="84"/>
<p class="para-p">“Quite.” Marcellinus swallowed.</p>
<p class="para-p">“When I heard the 33rd had perished, my first thought was for Corbulo. Such a waste.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Did Calidius Verus have a tear in his eye? Marcellinus tactfully looked away. “A waste indeed.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Gaius Marcellinus, if you would…How did my old friend meet his end? Did he die well?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Corbulo had found Marcellinus wanting as a Praetor and had led an attempted mutiny against him before the battle with Cahokia. He might even have instigated an earlier attempt on Marcellinus’s life in castra during the long trek across Nova Hesperia.</p>
<p class="para-p">In turn, Marcellinus had slain him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Would Verus want to hear that his good friend had perished at Marcellinus’s hand? If Marcellinus revealed this bald truth, what might Verus do?</p>
<p class="para-p">“Corbulo died fighting, as he would have wished. He was always a fierce soldier and a cunning strategist. He…brooked no retreat.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Verus nodded. “You were close by when it happened?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I was, sir. It happened not far from here, just to the south of Cahokia. But I am afraid I can tell you no more.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus stared stoically at the trees across the river, waiting for the inevitable next question. He felt Verus’s long gaze upon him.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Very well,” Verus said eventually. “I thank you for your candor.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Praetor patted Marcellinus on the arm, the fleeting touch of a comrade in sorrow, and walked away across the deck back to the helmsman. Marcellinus frowned out at the waters and glanced down at the ranks of oars beneath him, moving back and forth in perfect synchronization. And finally, unwillingly, he glanced back along the deck.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page85" title="85"/>
<p class="para-p">Maybe it was best to get all his unpleasant introductions over at once.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The Chitimachan was young and wiry and wore her hair in three braids. Perhaps twenty-five winters of age, she sat with her back straight and her hands clasped. Odd swirling tattoos lined her arms and shoulders, and she wore a fur tunic despite the moistness of the day. After all, where she had grown up it was even hotter. Marcellinus greeted her in Cahokian, and she responded in flawless Latin while examining him carefully from top to toe.</p>
<p class="para-p">Her fellow translator had come back to join them and now bowed to Marcellinus in the Roman fashion. “Wanageeska. This is a pleasant surprise.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The youth was taller and broader in the shoulder and met his eye with a boldness rarely shown by the boy he used to be. “Surprise?” Marcellinus said. “You did not know you were assigned to me?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Guide a squadron of Roman horse to the People of the Hand,” Pezi said in Latin, and then reverted to Cahokian. “That is all I was told. But I am happy to serve a man I already know to be brave and resourceful. Perhaps I may even return alive from the desert of the madmen.”</p>
<p class="para-p">It was somewhat galling to discover that the friendlier of his new interpreters was a boy he despised. “Pezi, the last time I saw you, beneath an Iroqua stage, you sneered at me and threatened me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi nodded, not embarrassed. “You sent me to the Iroqua. Once among them, I had to serve them. They ordered me to interrogate you. How would I have fared if I had refused, if they had thought I was your spy?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Calidius Verus was watching them from the rear deck. Marcellinus bit back a sharp retort. “I merely sent you with a message.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And once I took that message, my debt to you was paid. You no longer owned me, Wanageeska. I owed you nothing. Is this not so?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It is so.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page86" title="86"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus turned away, but Pezi stepped forward to stay by his side as he walked across the deck of the <em class="char-i">Minerva</em>. “Nonetheless, I still give you my thanks and my loyalty. For without you, I would be dead.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Think nothing of it,” Marcellinus said shortly.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Wanageeska…Gaius Marcellinus?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi’s hand was on his arm. Marcellinus glowered at it icily until the youth removed it. “Gaius Marcellinus. I was Iroqua. And then I was Cahokian. And then Iroqua again, and now I serve Roma. You were Roman, Cahokian, then Roman again. We are not different.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus stared at him in disbelief. “You betrayed Cahokia to the Iroqua. You told them where high-ranking Cahokians lived so that Iroqua assassins could seek them out. We are very different, Pezi.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi shook his head and grinned. The youth had acquired an astonishingly thick skin, for even in the face of Marcellinus’s anger he continued: “And yet now we want the same thing, which is for Roma to succeed, for the Mongols to be defeated, for the land…” He looked around briefly to ensure they were not overheard. “For the land to be free. Now we are allies. Is <em class="char-i">that</em> not so?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was not taking kindly to being lectured by the word slave. “We have a job to do, Pezi. And we will do that job. For now? Leave me alone. This conversation is over.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus certainly needed time to himself. Just as he had two years earlier when, sailing up the Wemissori in search of Tahtay, he could not escape the nagging fear that he was traveling in exactly the wrong direction at exactly the wrong time and leaving his Cahokian friends in the lurch. However, now as then, he had little choice. His mission was critical. It was even closely aligned with his previous desire to make a Hesperian League.</p>
<p class="para-p">In the meantime he would be leading Roman soldiers again, men whom he didn’t know and who were obviously leery of him, undertaking a long voyage by river and desert to a tribe of reputedly savage warriors whom even the Shappa Ta’atani thought bloodthirsty, while having to rely on Pezi and the Chitimachan.</p>
<p class="para-p">Perhaps it was a good thing he had brought Taianita along after all. He glanced toward the prow of the galley, but she was not hard to spot. She sat inside a protective ring of people not wearing Roman garb: Mahkah, Hanska and Mikasi, Enopay and Kanuna, and Isleifur Bjarnason.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page87" title="87"/>
<p class="para-p">What had Marcellinus gotten his friends into now? He didn’t know. Shaking his head and resolutely avoiding meeting the eye of Calidius Verus, he threaded his way between the horses of the Second Aravacorum to go sit next to Enopay.</p></div></body></html>

<p class="para-pf-alt" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">“T</span>hey will lay the Mongol Khan’s body in a great cart,” Pezi said. “They will carry him home in a long procession across the Grass back to the west, back to a ship, back to the Mongol land he comes from. And in that land there will be a kurultai.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay shook his head. “A what?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“A council,” Hadrianus said. “A powwow. To choose the Khan’s successor. Which, given the hatred and jealousy that Jochi, Chagatai, and Ogodei have for one another, will be no easy task.”</p>
<p class="para-p">It was a meeting of the invalids. The Imperator lay flat on his couch, his stomach bound tightly in white linen. He was gray-faced and sallow, and his eyes were only half open. To Hadrianus’s left stood his chief medicus, an elderly Greek with a lined face who fussed over him and whom he was constantly having to wave away.</p>
<p class="para-p">Not ten feet from him, lying in a wooden cot that two legionaries had carried into the Imperial presence, was Pezi, sometime word slave of the Iroqua, Cahokia, Roma, and the Mongols. Both of Pezi’s legs had been broken and were set and splinted with wood to keep them straight. Once again Marcellinus was in the presence of a brave young man who might never walk properly again.</p>
<p class="para-p">Also crowded into the Praetorium tent behind the Imperator were Lucius Agrippa and his First Tribune, Mettius Fronto, both looking battered and bruised; Aurelius Dizala from the Sixth; and the First Tribune of the Third Parthica, Antonius Caster. Standing with Marcellinus were Sintikala and Enopay.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page460" title="460"/>
<p class="para-p">“The Mongol Khan will be buried at the place of his birth.” Pezi paused, trying to remember. “Khenti Aimag? The Onon River? A place of good medicine for the Mongols. Far-and-far.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded. Central Asia was indeed a very long way from here.</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita sat by Pezi’s side, her face the picture of concern. Her past gratitude for Pezi’s valor on her behalf was equaled by her care for him now that he had been recovered. She had stayed with him while he was unconscious and had helped the legionary medicus do his work on the boy. As Pezi spoke, he occasionally glanced sideways at her, as if startled that someone like Taianita could possibly care whether he lived or died.</p>
<p class="para-p">By now everyone knew that Taianita was for Tahtay, and Tahtay for Taianita. But Taianita and Pezi shared an odd bond: both had been word slaves for harsh, sadistic masters, and Pezi had spoken up for Taianita and almost died for it.</p>
<p class="para-p">And then Pezi had risked his life once again. Attacking the great Chinggis Khan with a puny knife on the battlefield was one of the bravest things Marcellinus had ever seen. Pezi was as far from being a warrior as it was possible to get, yet he had acted without hesitation at a crucial moment. What must he have endured in the Khan’s service to provoke such a desperate gamble? Marcellinus had decided he would never ask.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was scarcely in any better condition than the Imperator or Pezi, beaten and banged up as always. When Chumanee had caught sight of him, she had merely nodded and gotten to work. She had carved the arrowhead out of his chest, thoroughly cleansed his wounds with her dark liquid, and painted them with her thick white salve before binding them up with Cahokian woven cloth.</p>
<p class="para-p">For preferring Cahokian care to Roman, Lucius Agrippa had called Marcellinus a barbarian. Marcellinus, too exhausted to argue, had merely agreed.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay had somehow survived the battle without serious injury. The renewed gash in his leg had proved to be superficial, though his many bruises and blisters made him grimace. Now he stirred. “The Mongols have withdrawn. They spent last night in a camp thirty miles back. They have sent no flanking actions. Their army retreats undivided. Our scouts have spoken, Norse as well as Cahokian, and Sintikala and the Hawks confirm it.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page461" title="461"/>
<p class="para-p">“They are all-done,” Pezi said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps we should continue to watch a little longer,” Dizala said drily.</p>
<p class="para-p">“And we will,” said Tahtay. “For maybe they are just resting, as we are. Perhaps they plan to return to do battle with us again later.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi frowned. “Do Mongol riders hurry west, ahead of the main army?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Since Sintikala showed no sign of responding, Marcellinus said, “Yes. Our Hawks and scouts have seen three jaghuns of Keshik riders galloping west, each with many remounts. They’re traveling fast.” So fast that the disgruntled Bjarnason and Stenberg had not been able to keep up in their attempt to shadow the group. But Sintikala had seen them, and Demothi and the others continued to watch over them as they rode.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Then I am right,” Pezi said. “Chagatai will make haste to leave Nova Hesperia. He probably rides with that forward group. His armies will not be back.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator nodded weakly. “I agree. But explain it to them if you would.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Pezi took the beaker of water Taianita pushed into his hand, drank, and spoke. “Chinggis Khan is dead. His trusted Keshik bodyguards must take the news back to the Mongol heartland and the Khan’s other sons as soon as they can. And so Chagatai must go with them, to bend the Keshiks to his will, and shape how the news is spoken and heard once they get home.</p>
<p class="para-p">“At kurultai, the brothers and their armies will meet. There, Chagatai must present himself as the man who helped conquer the huge realm of western Nova Hesperia and whose wife still rules it on his behalf. In addition, he must proclaim himself the hero who dealt the Roman army a mortal blow. Chagatai must recount this as his triumph. He must steal victory from defeat. Otherwise he is merely the son who could not prevent his father from being slain.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page462" title="462"/>
<p class="para-p">“And so Chagatai gains no advantage by fighting on. If he and the Great Khan had conquered the whole of Nova Hesperia, his claim to be chosen as Chinggis’s successor would be that much stronger. If he could take back gold and furs, that would help, too. But he cannot, and further glory and booty would take too long to acquire. He will leave.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Agrippa nodded crisply. “By Mongol standards there’s little enough in Nova Hesperia to plunder. The gold is still in the ground, and there are no carpets or silks or fine glass, no rich nobles to fleece. If I were Chagatai, I’d certainly go home. Stake my claim to become the Great Khan and seek richer lands to prey on.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Leaving his army to follow behind in the command of Subodei Badahur,” Pezi added. “The army, bearing the body of the Khan.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The other Romans were nodding, but the Cahokians were lost and even Marcellinus had to ask. “Pezi, are you sure?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Iroqua word slave took another drink and rubbed his leg. “I spent much time learning the Mongol tongue and talking with their captains. Ingratiating myself helped ensure my survival, I think. So I constantly talked and listened.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Of that, at least, Marcellinus had no doubt.</p>
<p class="para-p">“At the moment, the blame for the loss of so many men can be placed at the Khan’s door,” Fronto said thoughtfully. “And at Jebei Noyon’s, since he’s also usefully dead. Chagatai will claim the credit for rescuing as much as possible from a bad situation. Dealing a heavy blow to the legions and an injury to Roma’s Imperator against heavy odds. And two other leading Praetors are dead. All respect due, Imperator; that might play well on the steppes.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Painfully slowly, Hadrianus sat up. “He’ll need every advantage he can get. Jochi and Chagatai have always hated each other. Jochi is rash and showed his father too little respect. Chagatai is ruthless and unbending, hot-tempered. That is why Chinggis brought Chagatai here with him to Nova Hesperia, so that he would not go to war with his brother Jochi while the Great Khan’s eyes were elsewhere.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page463" title="463"/>
<p class="para-p">Pezi thought for a moment. “The captains told me that because of this feud between the first two brothers, Chinggis wanted Ogodei as his successor. But Ogodei is now chief of the Jin and Song Empires, which are huge and grand. He has less interest in being paramount chief and conquering other lands. Many of the Mongol captains favor the fourth brother, Tolui, but he treads warily around Jochi and Chagatai. I think I have that right?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes.” Agrippa turned to Marcellinus and the tribunes. “So far, so good. Everything Pezi says confirms our intelligence, but that is now several years old. Who knows what has happened in the Mongol lands in the meantime? Chagatai must be keen to find out.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Chinggis wanted the Imperator of Roma dead, and all his generals.” Pezi ducked his head, almost cringing, in an echo of his fawning, submissive behavior of the past. “Wanted this above all else, to prove that he was the strongest, the Chosen-by-Heaven, the ruler of the world. But Chagatai thinks only of power and plunder. Freed from his father, he will leave to fight other wars.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus knew little enough of Mongol politics and personalities, but he certainly understood the logistics of Hesperian travel. “The timing would make sense. It’s late in the Flower Moon now—almost the month of Julius. If Chagatai and his Keshiks hurry, just a few strong men on fast horses with many remounts, they can get back over the Great Mountains before the snows come, then back to the western coast of the continent. Maybe even set sail, if they can. But if they delay, they’ll have to either overwinter east of the mountains until the snows melt in spring or take a long detour south…through the lands of the People of the Hand.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay had been waiting to say something for some time, with gradually increasing agitation. Now he broke in. “But what if you are all wrong? You speak of what sort of man this Mongol is, or that Mongol, and how far it is to the edge of the land as if this were finished. But what if the Mongols turn and ride back to strike Cahokia?”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator gestured. “Gaius Marcellinus?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“If they do, we will get there first,” Marcellinus said. “Forward Camp is a little over four hundred miles from Cahokia. At the Mongols’ best, if each of their warriors has several replacement mounts, they can travel eighty or ninety miles a day. That would take them a little over five days. But they cannot be at their best after two hard-fought battles. The men will be weary, and our Wakinyan attacks destroyed a number of their remounts.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page464" title="464"/>
<p class="para-p">He nodded to Enopay, who cleared his throat importantly and continued. “But also there are rivers. If the army rides south, they must cross the Braided River and two other rivers before they get to Cahokia-across-the-water, and then cross the Mizipi to get to Cahokia itself. If they go north instead, they will cross the Wemissori and follow it, then cross the Mizipi north of Cahokia, and another river or two, and Cahokia Creek. For either route, all those rivers will add much time. The four-legs can swim, but then they are tired and must rest, and if the Mongols want to take their big weapons, the trebuchets and fire lances and Firebirds, they will need a pontoon bridge or lots of rafts. So, eight days, then? Ten? More?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And traveling down the Wemissori on the quinqueremes, with the current, if we hurry, we can be back at Cahokia in four,” Marcellinus finished.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay looked doubtful. “Your big canoes cannot take all your Roman and my Hesperian warriors and all their horses. We have not lost so many that everyone would fit.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“The cavalry will come overland,” Marcellinus said. “But our ships can ferry them across the rivers. The Mongols have only the Tlingit canoes, too small to help much with a large force of men and horses.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And if the Mongols turn, we will know right away,” Enopay added.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala inclined her head. Her Hawks were keeping the Mongols under constant scrutiny, and flying far and wide over the whole area of Cahokia down to Ocatan and beyond to protect against any surprises. In Asia and Europa the Mongols were renowned for their lightning attacks, but it was much harder for them to appear out of nowhere when they could be watched from above and their progress could be assessed.</p>
<p class="para-p">“We will remain here at Forward Camp a few days longer, Tahtay,” said the Imperator. “Regroup. Rest. Heal. Then, if the Mongols continue to retreat, we will start our own withdrawal.” He smiled. “Well done, Pezi. Well done.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page465" title="465"/>
<p class="para-p">Pezi glowed. Taianita grinned.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus and Enopay looked at each other quizzically. These were strange days indeed.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">As they walked out of the tent together, back into the turmoil and havoc of Forward Camp, Tahtay wrinkled his nose. “This camp is a dirty hell. I would think it the most evil place imaginable if I had not seen war.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus checked around them. The tribunes had made haste back to their cohorts, and Enopay had stayed behind to talk further with Pezi and Taianita. It was the first time he had been truly alone with Tahtay since before the battles, and gods knew they had been through hell in the meantime. Had Tahtay forgiven him yet? He racked his brains for a safe topic. “I still can’t believe you pinned your sash for the Imperator of Roma.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I had no choice. And Enopay would have done the same.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus raised his eyebrows. “Enopay would crawl a thousand miles before he’d face a man with a sword in battle.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay walked beside him companionably enough. “And for Enopay that is the right choice, because we need him to think, not fight. But I meant that his words were in my head when I pinned my sash. It is what Enopay would have told me to do. If the Imperator had died, what then of Cahokia afterward? Could I trust Agrippa or even Sabinus? I do not think so.”</p>
<p class="para-p">At Marcellinus’s silence, Tahtay looked sideways at him. “And if I had not, Hotah? What if instead of pinning my sash and fighting for your Imperator, the war chief of Cahokia had run away or stood aside and let Hadrianus and his men burn? What would his legionaries and tribunes say then? That was not possible. I had to show dignitas, and virtus, and animus.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Dignity, valor, and martial spirit. “You’re right,” Marcellinus admitted. “That’s exactly what Enopay would say.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page466" title="466"/>
<p class="para-p">“And besides, I like Hadrianus. Of all the new Romans, he is the one I least want to see burned to a crisp or rotting in a hole in the ground.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Perhaps that was not so hard to understand. Marcellinus had long ago noted the strange kinship between the war chief and the Imperator. They shared the loneliness of command, the responsibility of knowing that all eyes were on them all the time. Marcellinus himself knew something about that.</p>
<p class="para-p">“And he and I swore an oath in blood to stand together against the Mongol Khan. You do not remember, you who love oaths so much?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Certainly Marcellinus remembered that. But to this day he did not believe that the swearing of such oaths meant as much to the Imperator as it did to him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay nodded. “The Imperator has my blood in him now, as I have his. That will help him heal. And perhaps help him keep faith with us now that we have stood by his side in battle.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I hope you are right,” Marcellinus said. “I really do.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay stopped walking and poked a hole in the mud with his moccasin. “And when Roma leaves, you will go with them?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No,” Marcellinus said, shocked, and then: “You believe Roma will leave?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of course. They have won their war here. Why would they stay?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus could think of a dozen reasons, but right now Tahtay’s first question was more important to him. “When I agreed to lead the Sixth Ferrata into battle against the Mongol Khan, it was on the condition that I would be discharged once the war was won. That I’d retire from the army, here in Nova…in Hesperia.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Now that he had said the words, Marcellinus could not remember whether Hadrianus had in fact explicitly agreed to this. He frowned.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Ah. You arranged all that with the Imperator, then?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked up quickly. “With your permission, of course, war chief. Always, I would work for my grain, for Cahokia…”</p>
<p class="para-p">It was the paramount chief’s prerogative to say who could live in Cahokia and who could not. If Tahtay held too many grudges, Marcellinus could quickly become a man without a country. Again.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page467" title="467"/>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay stared at him long and hard, and then grinned wryly. “Of course. For if I said not, Kimimela would break my balls and my Hawk chief would never smile again for the rest of her life. Her smiles are rare enough even now. And then there is Nahimana, and Takoda, and Hanska.” He met Marcellinus’s eye. “But I had to ask, because you seem so…Roman again now. And also—I must admit it: sometimes I think Cahokia should be just for Cahokians, and Hesperia just for Hesperians.”</p>
<p class="para-p">After another uncomfortable silence, Marcellinus checked around himself again for eavesdroppers and said: “I agree. And I also agree that Roma must leave. Whether they wish it or not.”</p></div></body></html>

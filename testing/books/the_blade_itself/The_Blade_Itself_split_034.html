<div id="filepos937242" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Words and Dust</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Kurster pranced around the outside of the circle, his long golden hair bouncing on his shoulders, waving to the crowd, blowing kisses to the girls. The audience cheered and howled and whooped as the lithe young man made his flashy rounds. He was an Aduan, an officer of the King’s Own. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A local boy, and so very popular.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bremer dan Gorst was leaning against the barrier, watching his opponent dance through barely open eyes. His steels were unusually heavy-looking, weighty and worn and well-used, too heavy to be quick perhaps. Gorst himself looked too heavy to be quick, come to that, a great thick-necked bull of a man, more like a wrestler than a swordsman. He looked the underdog in this bout. The majority of the crowd seemed to think so. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But I know better.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Nearby a bet-maker was shouting odds, taking money from the babbling people around him. Nearly all of the bets were for Kurster. Glokta leaned across from his bench. “What odds are you giving on Gorst now?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“On Gorst?” asked the bet-maker, “evens.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’ll take two hundred marks.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Sorry, friend, I can’t cover that.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A hundred then, at five to four.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The bet-maker thought about it for a moment, looking skywards as he worked out the sums in his head. “Done.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta sat back as the referee introduced the contestants, watching Gorst roll up his shirt-sleeves. The man’s forearms were thick as tree trunks, heavy cords of muscle squirming as he worked his meaty fingers. He stretched his thick neck to one side and the other, then he took his steels from his second and loosed a couple of practice jabs. Few in the crowd noticed. They were busy cheering Kurster as he took his mark. But Glokta saw. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Quicker than he looks. A lot, lot quicker. Those heavy steels no longer seem so clumsy.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bremer dan Gorst!” shouted the referee, as the big man trudged to his mark. The applause was meagre indeed. This lumbering bull was no one’s idea of a swordsman.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Begin!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It wasn’t pretty. From the very start Gorst swung his heavy long steel in great heedless sweeps, like a champion woodsman chopping logs, giving throaty growls with every blow. It was a strange sight. One man was in a fencing contest, the other seemed to think he was fighting to the death. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">You only have to touch him, man, not split him in half.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> But as Glokta watched, he realised the mighty cuts were not nearly so clumsy as they seemed. They were well-timed, and highly accurate. Kurster laughed as he danced away from the first great swing, smiled as he dodged the third, but by the fifth his smile was long gone. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And it doesn’t look like coming back.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It wasn’t pretty at all. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But the power is undeniable.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Kurster ducked desperately under another great arcing cut. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">That one was hard enough to take his head off, blunted steels or no.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The crowd’s favourite did his best to seize the initiative, jabbing away for all he was worth, but Gorst was more than equal to it. He grunted as he turned the jabs efficiently away with his short steel, then growled again as he brought his long whistling around and over. Glokta winced as it smashed into Kurster’s sword with a resounding crash, snapping the man’s wrist back and nearly tearing the steel from his fingers. He stumbled back from the force of it, grimacing with pain and shock.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Now I realise why Gorst’s steels seem so worn.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Kurster dodged around the circle, trying to escape the onslaught, but the big man was too quick. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Far too quick.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Gorst had the measure of him now, anticipating every movement, harrying his opponent with relentless blows. There was no escape.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Two heavy thrusts drove the hapless officer back towards the edge of the circle, then a scything cut ripped his long steel from his hand and embedded it, wobbling wildly back and forth, in the turf. He staggered for a moment, eyes wide, his empty hand trembling, then Gorst was on him, letting go a roar and ramming full-tilt into his defenceless ribs with a heavy shoulder.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta spluttered with laughter. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I never saw a swordsman fly before.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Kurster actually turned half a somersault, shrieking like a girl as he tumbled through the air, crashing to the ground with his limbs flopping and sliding away on his face. He finally came to rest in the sand outside the circle, a good three strides from where Gorst had hit him, groaning weakly.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The crowd was in shock, so quiet that Glokta’s cackling had to be audible on the back row. Kurster’s trainer rushed from his enclosure and gently turned his stricken student over. The young man kicked weakly, whimpered and clutched at his ribs. Gorst watched for a moment, emotionless, then shrugged and strolled back to his mark.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Kurster’s trainer turned to the referee. “I am sorry,” he said, “but my pupil cannot continue.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta could not help himself. He had to clamp his mouth shut with his hands. His whole body was shaking with laughter. Each gurgle caused a painful spasm in his neck, but he didn’t care. It seemed the majority of the crowd had not found the spectacle quite so amusing. Angry mutterings sprang up all around him. The grumbling turned to boos as Kurster was helped from the circle, draped between his trainer and his second, then the boos to a chorus of angry shouts.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Gorst swept the audience with his lazy, half-open eyes, then shrugged again and trudged slowly back to his enclosure. Glokta was still sniggering as he limped from the arena, his purse a good deal heavier than when he arrived. He hadn’t had that much fun in years.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The University stood in a neglected corner of the Agriont, directly in the shadow of the House of the Maker, where even the birds seemed old and tired. A huge, ramshackle building, coated in half-dead ivy, its design plainly from an earlier age. It was said to be one of the oldest buildings in the city. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And it looks it.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The roofs were sagging in the middle, a couple of them close to outright collapse. The delicate spires were crumbling, threatening to topple off into the unkempt gardens below. The render on the walls was tired and grimy, and in places whole sections had fallen away to reveal the bare stones and crumbling mortar beneath. In one spot a great brown stain flared out down the wall from a section of broken guttering. There had been a time when the study of sciences had attracted some of the foremost men in the Union, when this building had been among the grandest in the city. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And Sult thinks the Inquisition is out of fashion.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Two statues flanked the crumbling gate. Two old men, one with a lamp, one pointing at something in a book. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Wisdom and progress or some such rubbish.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The one with the book had lost his nose some time during the past century, the other was leaning at an angle, his lamp stuck out despairingly as though clutching for support.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta raised his fist and hammered on the ancient doors. They rattled, moved noticeably, as if they might at any moment drop from their hinges. Glokta waited. Waited some time.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a sudden clatter of bolts being drawn back, and one half of the door wobbled open a few inches. An ancient face wedged itself into the gap and squinted out at him, lit underneath by a meagre taper clutched in a withered hand. Dewy old eyes peered up and down. “Yes?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Inquisitor Glokta.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, from the Arch Lector?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta frowned, surprised. “Yes, that’s right.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">They cannot be half so cut off from the world as they appear. He seems to know who I am.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was perilously dark within. Two enormous brass candelabras stood on either side of the door, but they were stripped of candles and had long gone unpolished, shining dully in the weak light from the porter’s little taper. “This way, sir,” wheezed the old man, shambling off, bent nearly double. Even Glokta had little trouble keeping up with him as he crept away through the gloom.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They shuffled together down a shadowy hallway. The windows on one side were ancient, made with tiny panes of glass so dirty that they would have let in little enough light on the sunniest of days. They let in none whatever as the sullen evening came on. The flickering candleflame danced over dusty paintings on the opposite wall, pale old men in dark gowns of black and grey, gazing wild-eyed from their flaking frames, flasks and cog-wheels and pairs of compasses clutched in their aged hands.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Where are we going?” asked Glokta, after they had shambled through the murk for several minutes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Adepti are at dinner,” wheezed the porter, glancing up at him with eyes infinitely tired.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The University’s dining hall was an echoing cavern of a room, lifted one degree above total darkness by a few guttering candles. A small fire flickered in an enormous fireplace, casting dancing shadows among the rafters. A long table stretched the length of the floor, polished by long years of use, flanked by rickety chairs. It could easily have accommodated eighty but there were only five there, crowded up at one end, huddled in around the fireplace. They looked over as the taps of Glokta’s cane echoed through the hall, pausing in their meals and peering over with great interest. The man at the head of the table got to his feet and hurried over, holding the hem of his long black gown up with one hand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A visitor,” wheezed the porter, waving his candle in Glokta’s direction.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, from the Arch Lector! I am Silber, the University Administrator!” And he shook Glokta’s hand. His companions had meanwhile lurched and tottered to their feet as though the guest of honour had just arrived.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Inquisitor Glokta.” He stared round at the eager old men. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A good deal more deference than I was expecting, I must say. But then, the Arch Lectors name opens all kinds of doors.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Glokta, Glokta,” mumbled one of the old men, “seems that I remember a Glokta from somewhere.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You remember everything from somewhere, but you never remember where,” quipped the administrator, to half-hearted laughter. “Please let me make the introductions.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He went round the four black-gowned scientists, one by one. “Saurizin, our Adeptus Chemical.” A beefy, unkempt old fellow with burns and stains down the front of his robe and more than one bit of food in his beard. “Denka, the Adeptus Metallic.” The youngest of the four by a considerable margin, though by no means a young man, had an arrogant twist to his mouth. “Chayle, our Adeptus Mechanical.” Glokta had never seen a man with so big a head but so small a face. His ears, in particular, were immense, and sprouting grey hairs. “And Kandelau, the Adeptus Physical.” A scrawny old bird with a long neck and spectacles perched on his curving beak of a nose. “Please join us, Inquisitor,” and the administrator indicated an empty chair, wedged in between two of the Adepti.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A glass of wine then?” wheedled Chayle, a prim smile on his tiny mouth, already leaning forward with a decanter and sloshing some into a glass.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Very well.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We were just discussing the relative merits of our various fields of study,” murmured Kandelau, peering at Glokta through his flashing spectacles.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“As always,” lamented the Administrator.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The human body is, of course, the only area worthy of true scrutiny,” continued the Adeptus Physical. “One must appreciate the mysteries within, before turning one’s attention to the world without. We all have a body, Inquisitor. Means of healing it, and of harming it, are of paramount interest to us all. It is the human body that is my area of expertise.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bodies! Bodies!” whined Chayle, pursing his little lips and pushing food around his plate. “We are trying to eat!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Quite so! You are unsettling the Inquisitor with your ghoulish babble!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, I am not easily unsettled.” Glokta leered across the table, giving the Adeptus Metallic a good view of his missing teeth. “My work for the Inquisition demands a more than passing knowledge of anatomy.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was an uncomfortable silence, then Saurizin took hold of the meat plate and offered it out. Glokta looked at the red slices, glistening on the plate. He licked at his empty gums. “Thank you, no.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Is it true?” asked the Adeptus Chemical, peering over the meat, voice hushed. “Will there be more funds? Now that this business with the Mercers is settled, that is?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta frowned. Everyone was staring at him, waiting for his reply. One of the old Adepti had his fork frozen halfway to his mouth. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">So that’s it. Money. But why would they be expecting money from the Arch Lector?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The heavy meat plate was beginning to wobble. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Well… if it gets them listening.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Money might be made available, depending, of course, on results.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A hushed murmur crept around the table. The Adeptus Chemical carefully set down the plate with a trembling hand. “I have been having a great deal of success with acids recently.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hah!” mocked the Adeptus Metallic. “Results, the Inquisitor asked for, results! My new alloys will be stronger than steel when they are perfected!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Always the alloys!” sighed Chayle, turning his tiny eyes towards the ceiling. “No one appreciates the importance of sound mechanical thinking!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The other three Adepti rounded fiercely on him, but the Administrator jumped in first. “Gentlemen, please! The Inquisitor is not interested in our little differences! Everyone will have time to discuss their latest work and show its merits. This is not a competition, is it Inquisitor?” Every eye turned toward Glokta. He looked slowly round at those old, expectant faces, and said nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I have developed a machine for—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“My acids—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“My alloys—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The mysteries of the human body—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta cut them off. “Actually, it is in the area of… I suppose you would call them explosive substances, that I am currently taking a particular interest—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Adeptus Chemical jumped from his seat. “That would be my province!” he cried, staring in triumph at his colleagues. “I have samples! I have examples! Please follow me, Inquisitor!” And he tossed his cutlery onto his plate and set off towards one of the doors.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Saurizin’s laboratory was precisely as one would have expected, almost down to the last detail. A long room with a barrel-vaulted ceiling, blackened in places with circles and streaks of soot. Shelves covered most of the wall-space, brimming with a confusion of boxes, jars, bottles, each filled with its own powders, fluids, rods of strange metal. There was no apparent order to the positions of the various containers, and most had no labels. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Organisation does not appear to be a priority.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The benches in the middle of the room were even more confused, covered in towering constructions of glass and old brown copper: tubes, flasks and dishes, lamps—one with a naked flame burning. All gave the appearance of being ready at any moment to collapse, dousing anyone unfortunate enough to stand nearby with lethal, boiling poisons.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Adeptus Chemical rummaged in amongst this mess like a mole in its warren. “Now then,” he mumbled to himself, pulling at his dirty beard with one hand, “blasting powders are somewhere here…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta limped into the room after him, glancing suspiciously around at the mess of tubing that covered every surface. He wrinkled his nose. There was a revolting, acrid smell to the place.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Here it is!” crowed the Adeptus, brandishing a dusty jar half-full of black granules. He cleared a space on one of the benches, shoving the clinking and clanking glass and metal out of the way with a sweep of his meaty forearm. “This stuff is terribly rare, you know, Inquisitor, terribly rare!” He pulled out the stopper and tipped a line of black powder onto the wooden bench. “Few men have been fortunate enough to see this stuff in action! Very few! And you are about to become one of them!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta took a cautious step back, the size of the ragged hole in the wall of the Tower of Chains still fresh in his mind. “We are safe, I hope, at this distance?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Absolutely,” murmured Saurizin, gingerly holding a burning taper out at arm’s length and touching it to one end of the line of powder. “There is no danger whatso—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a sharp pop and a shower of white sparks. The Adeptus Chemical leaped back, nearly blundering into Glokta and dropping his lighted taper on the floor. There was another pop, louder, more sparks. A foul-smelling smoke began to fill the laboratory. There was a bright flash and a loud bang, a weak fizzling, and that was all.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Saurizin flapped the long sleeve of his gown in front of his face, trying to clear the thick smoke that had now thrown the whole chamber into gloom. “Impressive, eh, Inquisitor?” he asked, before dissolving into a fit of coughing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Not really.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta ground the still-flaming taper out under his boot and stepped through the murk towards the bench. He brushed aside a quantity of grey ash with the side of his hand. There was a long, black burn on the surface of the wood, but nothing more. The foul-smelling fumes were indeed the most impressive effect, already clawing at the back of Glokta’s throat. “It certainly produces a great deal of smoke,” he croaked.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It does,” coughed the Adeptus proudly, “and reeks to high heaven.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta stared at that blackened smear on the bench. “If one had a large enough quantity of this powder, could it be used to, say, knock a hole through a wall?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Possibly… if one could accumulate a large enough quantity, who knows what could be done? As far as I know no one has ever tried.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A wall, say, four feet thick?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Adeptus frowned. “Perhaps, but you’d need barrels of the stuff! Barrels! There isn’t that much in the whole Union, and the cost, even if it could be found, would be colossal! Please understand, Inquisitor, that the components must be imported from the distant south of Kanta, and are rarities even there. I would be happy to look into the possibility, of course, but I would need considerable funding—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Thank you again for your time.” Glokta turned and began to limp through the thinning smoke towards the door.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I have made some significant progress with acids recently!” cried the Adeptus, voice cracking. “You really should see those as well!” He took a shuddering breath. “Tell the Arch Lector… significant progress!” He dissolved into another fit of coughing, and Glokta shut the door tightly behind him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A waste of my time. Our Bayaz could not have smuggled barrels of powder into that room. Even then, how much smoke, how great a smell would it have made? A waste of my time.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Silber was lurking in the hallway outside. “Is there anything else that we can show you, Inquisitor?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta paused for a moment. “Does anyone here know anything about magic?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Administrator’s jaw muscles clenched. “A joke of course. Perhaps—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Magic, I said. “</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Silber narrowed his eyes. “You must understand that we are a scientific institution. The practice of magic, so called, would be most… inappropriate.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta frowned at the man. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I’m not asking you to get your wand out, fool.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “From a historical standpoint,” he snapped, “the Magi, and so on. Bayaz!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, from a historical standpoint, I see.” Silber’s taut face relaxed slightly. “Our library contains a wide range of ancient texts, some of them dating back to the period when magic was considered… less remarkable.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who can assist me?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Administrator raised his brows. “I am afraid that the Adeptus Historical is, ah, something of a relic.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I need to speak with him, not fence with him.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course, Inquisitor, this way.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta grabbed the handle of an ancient-looking door, studded with black rivets, began to turn it. He felt Silber seize his arm.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No!” he snapped, guiding Glokta away down a corridor beside. “The stacks are down here.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Adeptus Historical seemed indeed to be a part of ancient history himself. His face was a mask of lined and sagging half-transparent skin. Sparse hairs, snowy white, stuck unkempt from his head. There were only a quarter as many as there should have been, but each was four times longer than you would expect, hence his eyebrows were thin, yet sprouted out to impressive length in all directions, like the whiskers of a cat. His mouth hung slack, weak, and toothless, hands were withered gloves, several sizes too big. Only his eyes showed any trace of life, peering up at Glokta and the administrator as they approached.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Visitors, is it?” croaked the old man, apparently talking to a large black crow perched on his desk.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“This is Inquisitor Glokta!” bellowed the Administrator, leaning down towards the old man’s ear.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Glokta?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“From the Arch Lector!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Is it?” The Adeptus Historical squinted up with his ancient eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He’s somewhat deaf,” Silber murmured, “but no one knows these books like he does.” He thought about it for a moment, peering round at the endless stacks, disappearing into the gloom. “No one else knows these books at all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Thank you,” said Glokta. The Administrator nodded and strode off towards the stairs. Glokta took a step towards the old man and the crow leaped from the table and scrambled into the air, shedding feathers, flapping madly around the ceiling. Glokta hobbled painfully back. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I was sure the damn thing was stuffed.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He watched it suspiciously until it clattered to a halt on top of one of the shelves and perched there motionless, staring at him with its beady yellow eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta pulled out a chair and dropped into it. “I need to know about Bayaz.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bayaz,” muttered the ancient Adeptus. “The first letter in the alphabet of the old tongue, of course.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I didn’t know that.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The world’s brimming full of what you don’t know, young man.” The bird gave a sudden harsh caw, horribly loud in the dusty silence of the stacks. “Brimming full.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Then let’s begin my education. It’s the man Bayaz, I need to know about. The First of the Magi.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bayaz. The name great Juvens gave to his first apprentice. One letter, one name. First apprentice, first letter of the alphabet, you understand?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m just about keeping up. Did he really exist?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The ancient Adeptus scowled. “Unquestionably. Did you not have a tutor as a young man?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I did, unfortunately.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Did he not teach you history?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He tried, but my mind was on fencing and girls.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah. I lost interest in such things a long time ago.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So did I. Let us return to Bayaz.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man sighed. “Long ago, before there was a Union, Midderland was made of many petty kingdoms, often at war with one another, rising and falling with the passing years. One of these was ruled by a man called Harod, later to become Harod the Great. You’ve heard of him, I assume?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bayaz came to Harod’s throne room, and promised to make him King of all Midderland if he did as he was told. Harod, being young and headstrong, did not believe him, but Bayaz broke the long table with his Art.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Magic, eh?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So the story goes. Harod was impressed—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Understandable.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“—and he agreed to accept the advice of the Magus—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Which was?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“To make his capital here, in Adua. To make peace with certain neighbours, war with others, and when and how to do it.” The old man squinted across at Glokta. “Are you telling this story or am I?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You are.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And you’re taking your time about it.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bayaz was good as his word. In time Midderland was unified, Harod became its first High King, the Union was born.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Then what?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bayaz served as Harod’s chief counsellor. Our laws and statutes, the very structure of our government, all are said to be his inventions, little changed since those ancient days. He established the Councils, Closed and Open, he formed the Inquisition. On Harod’s death he left the Union, promising one day to return.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I see. How much of this is true, do you think?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hard to say. Magus? Wizard? Magician?” The old man looked at the flickering candle flame. “To a savage, that candle might be magic. It’s a fine line indeed, between magic and trickery, eh? But this Bayaz was a cunning mind in his day, that’s a fact.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">This is all useless.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “What about before?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Before what?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Before the Union. Before Harod.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man shrugged. “Record-keeping was hardly a priority during the dark ages. The whole world was in chaos after the war between Juvens and his brother Kanedias—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Kanedias? The Master Maker?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Aye.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Kanedias. He stares down from the walls of my little room in the cellars beneath Severard’s charming town house. Juvens dead, his eleven apprentices, the Magi, marching to avenge him. I know this tale.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Kanedias,” murmured Glokta, the image of that dark figure with the flames behind clear in his mind. “The Master Maker. Was he real?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hard to say. He’s in the ground between myth and history, I suppose. Probably there’s some grain of truth in it. Someone must have built that big bloody tower, eh?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Tower?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The House of the Maker!” The old man gestured at the room around them. “And they say he built all this as well.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What, this library?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man laughed. “The whole Agriont, or at least the rock on which it stands. The University too. He built it, appointed the first Adepti to help him with his works, whatever they were, to look into the nature of things. We here are the Maker’s disciples, yes, though I doubt they know it upstairs. He is gone but the work continues, eh?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“After a fashion. Where did he go?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hah. Dead. Your friend Bayaz killed him.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta raised an eyebrow. “Did he really?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So the story goes. Have you not read </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The Fall of the Master Maker</span></span><span class="calibre3">?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That rubbish? I thought it was all invention.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So it is. Sensational claptrap, but based on writings from the time.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Writings? Such things survive?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man narrowed his eyes. “Some.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Some? You have them here?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“One in particular.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta fixed the old man with his eye. “Bring it to me.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The ancient paper crackled as the Adeptus Historical carefully unrolled the scroll and spread it out on the table. The parchment was yellow and crumpled, edges rough with age, scrawled with a dense script: strange characters, utterly unintelligible to Glokta’s eye.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What is it written in?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The old tongue. Few can read this now.” The old man pointed to the first line. “An account of the fall of Kanedias, this says, the third of three.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Third of three?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of three scrolls, I presume.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Where are the other two?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Lost.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh.” Glokta peered into the endless darkness of the stacks. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">It’s a wonder anything can be found down here.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “What does this one say?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The ancient librarian peered down at the strange writing, poorly illuminated by the single flickering candle, his trembling forefinger tracing across the parchment, his lips moving silently. “Great was their fury.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s how it begins. Great was their fury.” He began slowly to read. “The Magi pursued Kanedias, driving his faithful before them. They broke his fortress, laying ruin to his buildings and killing his servants. The Maker himself, sore wounded in the battle with his brother Juvens, took refuge in his House.” The old man unrolled a little more. “Twelve days and twelve nights, the Magi threw their wrath against the gates, but could not mark them. Then Bayaz found a way inside…” The Adeptus swept his hand over the parchment in frustration. Damp, or something, had blurred the characters in the next section. “I can’t make this out… something about the Makers daughter?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You sure?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No!” snapped the old man. “There’s a whole section missing!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ignore it then! What’s the next thing you can be sure of?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, let’s see… Bayaz followed him to the roof, and cast him down.” The old man noisily cleared his throat. “The Maker fell burning, and broke upon the bridge below. The Magi searched high and low for the Seed, but could not find it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Seed?” asked Glokta, baffled.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s all that’s written.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What the hell does it mean?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man sagged back in his chair, evidently enjoying this rare opportunity to hold forth on his area of expertise. “The end of the age of myth, the beginning of the age of reason. Bayaz, the Magi, they represent order. The Maker is a god-like figure: superstition, ignorance, I don’t know. There must be some truth to him. After all, someone built that big bloody tower,” and he wheezed with breathy laughter.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta could not be bothered to point out that the Adeptus had made the very same joke a few minutes before. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And it wasn’t funny then. Repetition—the curse of the old.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “What about this Seed?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Magic, secrets, power? It’s all a metaphor.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I will not impress the Arch Lector with metaphors. Especially bad ones.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Is there no more?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It goes on a bit, let’s see.” He looked back at the symbols. “He broke on the bridge, they searched for the Seed…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, yes.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Patience, Inquisitor.” His withered finger traced across the characters. “They sealed up the House of the Maker. They buried the fallen, Kanedias and his daughter among them. That’s all.” He peered at the page, his finger hovering over the last few letters. “And Bayaz took the key. That’s all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta’s eyebrows went up. “What? What was that last bit?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They sealed the gates, they buried the fallen, and Bayaz took the key.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The key? The key to the House of the Maker?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Adeptus Historical squinted back at the page. “That’s what it says.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">There is no key. That tower has stood sealed for centuries, everyone knows it. Our impostor will have no key, that’s sure.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Slowly, Glokta began to smile. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">It is thin, it is very thin, but with the right setting, the right emphasis, it might be enough. The Arch Lector will be pleased.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’ll be taking this.” Glokta pulled the ancient scroll over and started to roll it up.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What?” The eyes of the Adeptus were wide with horror. “You can’t!” He staggered up from his chair, even more painfully than Glokta might have done. His crow scrambled up with him, flapping around near the ceiling and croaking in a fury, but Glokta ignored them both. “You can’t take it! It’s irreplaceable,” wheezed the old man, making a hopeless grab for the scroll.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta spread his arms out wide. “Stop me! Why don’t you? I’d like to see it! Can you imagine? We two cripples, floundering around in the stacks with a bird loosing its droppings on us, tugging this old piece of paper to and fro?” He giggled to himself. “That wouldn’t be very dignified, would it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Adeptus Historical, exhausted by his pitiful efforts, crumpled back into his chair, breathing hard. “No one cares about the past any more,” he whispered. “They don’t see that you can’t have a future without a past.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">How very deep.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta slipped the rolled-up parchment into his coat and turned to leave.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who’s going to look after the past, when I’m gone?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who cares?” asked Glokta as he stalked towards the steps, “as long as it isn’t me.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_34"></div></div></body>

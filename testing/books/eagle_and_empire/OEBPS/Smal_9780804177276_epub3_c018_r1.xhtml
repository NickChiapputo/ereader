<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">T</span>he Second Cahokian galloped across the grass with Mahkah out in front and Gaius Marcellinus trying to stay alongside them without risking serious physical injury. He was sitting forward in the saddle as far as he dared, leaning into the movement, but such a gallop would always feel precarious to him, especially with snow still on the ground.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then the Wakinyan roared over them. His horse’s head jerked back, eyes wide, and for a terrifying moment Marcellinus thought his mount might lose its mind and bolt.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now Hanska and the Third galloped in, converging from the right to form a single column. As the lines came together, Hanska kicked her horse forward, and she, too, began to pull away from him.</p>
<p class="para-p">At this speed it was all Marcellinus could do to stay on his horse. It was galling to have to admit that Mahkah and Hanska were already better riders than he was.</p>
<p class="para-p">Ahead, Mahkah’s arm came up, and the two companies slowed to a canter and then a trot. As best he could, Marcellinus tried to line himself up with the Cahokian warriors on either side of him to form an organized rank.</p>
<p class="para-p">He was panting almost as much as his horse. Shit.</p>
<p class="para-p">Another Wakinyan came over and released Cahokian liquid flame in a long thin stream two hundred feet in front of them.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page280" title="280"/>
<p class="para-p">In principle, the horses could take this in stride. The mounted companies had spent weeks trying to accustom them to incendiaries. If the cavalry all went to hell at the first whiff of black powder and the first spark of flame, the war was already lost.</p>
<p class="para-p">In practice, the horses still spooked badly. Troopers split off to the right and left. Some horses bolted altogether, and others stopped dead. Horses bumped into other horses. To Marcellinus’s relief his own steed took the flame rather calmly, perhaps because this time its view was proscribed by its blinders and by the two horses in front.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Gods,” Marcellinus said at last to the brave riding next to him when they got all their mounts under control and Mahkah signaled a return to the Mizipi, some four miles away. “This is…hard work.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The warrior might have answered, but he was too busy quivering and trying to wipe the sweat out of his eyes.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay was right after all. These animals were a menace. Time to switch to something safer.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">It had been another hard winter. The Mizipi had frozen again, all the way across, and the Polovtsian auxiliaries had exercised out on its icy surface with frost nails in their horses’ shoes to prevent them from slipping. Most Roman cavalry alae would exercise carefully in snow but drew the line at ice. But the peoples of central Asia habitually treated rivers as roads in the winter months and, if anything, seemed more comfortable exercising when the temperatures were below freezing than they did in the heat and haze of the summer.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was perpetually cold, but the buffalo robe he had been gifted by the Hidatsa after the hunt helped. And often he was rushing from place to place with such vigor that he generated his own warmth.</p>
<p class="para-p">For half of his time he was a Cahokian, living with Sintikala and Kimimela on the Mound of the Hawk Chief, working with the Hesperian craftsmen who fabricated the flying machines, talking strategy with Tahtay and Enopay, or making love with Sintikala.</p>
<p class="para-p">For the other half he was the Praetor of the Sixth Ironclads, sleeping in his Praetorium house at the center of a Roman fortress on the west bank of the Mizipi, his days full of exercises, supplies, issues of discipline, and a thousand other details. Marcellinus’s two lives had converged in quite an astonishing way to somehow become the best parts of both.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page281" title="281"/>
<p class="para-p">For Marcellinus had grown weary of subterfuge. He no longer concealed his Cahokian relationships from Roma. Nor would he hide his growing camaraderie with his tribunes and men of the Sixth Ferrata from his Cahokian friends. Let everyone, Cahokian or Roman, judge him for who he was and what he did. And in that, it surely helped that Sintikala, Kimimela, and the other Hawk and Thunderbird pilots were themselves held in deep respect by the Romans for their almost supernatural abilities in the air.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala never came to the Fortress of the Thunderbolt, as the Cahokians called the castra of the Sixth because of the massive lightning insignia in gold and red over its eastern gate that was visible even on the far bank of the river. Tahtay visited occasionally. Enopay, of course, as Marcellinus’s adjutant and connoisseur of all things Roman, was there constantly and perhaps spent even more time in the fortress than Marcellinus did. The boy now spoke Latin like a Roman and was on first-name terms with the quartermaster and chief medicus, the ship’s masters of the quinqueremes, the weapons men and blacksmiths and sutlers. And when Enopay was not with the Sixth, he was likely to be visiting the Fortress of the Bull of the Legio III Parthica. More than once Marcellinus had walked into the Praetorium of Decinius Sabinus only to find Enopay in earnest discussion with the Praetor, his satchel open and his birch-bark notes spread across the table. It was quite possible that the boy was greasing the wheels of Roman-Cahokian cooperation more effectively than anybody else.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay was now maybe fourteen winters and at last was beginning to resemble a young man rather than an unsettlingly precocious boy. Kimimela was seventeen winters, smart and energetic. And Tahtay was twenty winters and was growing into the strong and capable war chief Cahokia needed.</p>
<p class="para-p">As for Marcellinus, at the last Midwinter Feast he had turned fifty years old. His three “children” viewed this milestone with awe, as if he were suddenly an elder or perhaps merely a fragile thing that needed to be tended with care. Marcellinus took it in good humor. He was fit and determined, hearty and strong, and exactly where he needed to be.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page282" title="282"/>
<p class="para-p">And so Marcellinus went from Sintikala’s bed to training Romans and Hesperians, often in the bitter cold and wind; to walking the fortress of the Sixth Ironclads; to working in Cahokia’s foundries and new factories; to talking with Tahtay, Kimimela, and Enopay; to dining with the Imperator and the other Praetors. One day he might exercise with the Cahokian cohorts, the next with the cohorts of the Sixth Legion, and on yet other days with parts of both together.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was almost desperately happy. That desperation led to him living each day as if it were his last, attempting to cram as much toil and usefulness and self-awareness and passion into it as he possibly could. Marcellinus and Sintikala could not make up for lost time, and even now could scarcely make up for the time he spent with his legion or she with her clan. But they gave it their very best efforts.</p>
<p class="para-p">Certainly they were under no illusions. Terrible times were ahead. The odds of their both surviving the coming months were slender indeed. That just made it all the more important to wring as much joy out of each day and night as was humanly possible.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Snow drifted across the East Plaza in the freshening breeze. Enopay was the last to arrive, and he was grumpy. “Everyone else hides inside. What is so important that we cannot do the same?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It’s hard to get you all together at once.”</p>
<p class="para-p">With Marcellinus already were Aelfric, Tahtay, and Kimimela. “All?” said Aelfric.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, at a time when <em class="char-i">I</em> am not busy, too,” Marcellinus amended. “Anyway. Do you remember this?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“This” was the elastic material from the south. The Iroqua had used it at Woshakee long before, the Shappa Ta’atani had used it to propel their winged priestesses into the air from the Temple Mound, and Sintikala had acquired a roll of it at the Market of the Mud. At that time they had thought to use it to launch their Hawks, but the experiments they had conducted with Kimimela on the Wemissori had been disheartening. None of them had paid attention to the material for a long while.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page283" title="283"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus turned to Aelfric. “Do you remember what you said about it at the time?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Make a belt?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And whip it off, snap a rock into someone’s eye with it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And how well does that work? Come on, man. If you didn’t already know, we wouldn’t be freezing our feet off having this conversation.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You’re the best among us with a sling,” Marcellinus said to Tahtay. “Wouldn’t you say so?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps. Better than <em class="char-i">you</em>, surely.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“<em class="char-i">I</em> protected you with a sling well enough when Ifer’s men tried to steal the <em class="char-i">Concordia</em> at the market,” said Kimimela, aggrieved.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had forgotten that. “Yes, of course. Sorry. So in that case, I challenge you both.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay and Kimimela looked at each other and then at him. “We accept,” Kimimela said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You don’t even know what I’m going to say,” he protested.</p>
<p class="para-p">“We don’t need to ask,” Tahtay said. “You’re going to use that toy elastic stuff against Kimimela and me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, not <em class="char-i">against</em>. Sharpshooting.” They looked unsure. He simplified. “Target practice.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay, as it happened, had his sling in his pouch, although it was unlikely that he ever saw a rabbit in the streets of Cahokia. Marcellinus had brought several slings, some of which had traveled all the way down and back up the Mizipi with him, and Kimimela chose one. Meanwhile, Enopay ran off and came back with six pots from his great-aunt’s fireplace. Marcellinus decided not to inquire whether he had asked permission to take them.</p>
<p class="para-p">They lined the pots up on the grass about fifty feet away, and then Marcellinus produced his slingshot: a Y-shaped piece of steel, hastily made, with a length of the southern elastic material attached to the top spokes of the Y.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page284" title="284"/>
<p class="para-p">“What?” They studied the device suspiciously.</p>
<p class="para-p">“The advantage is that you don’t need to whirl it around your head like a sling. It’s quicker. You draw it back, place the stone in it.” He did it once and shot a pebble into the air. “Oops.” They lost sight of it immediately in the swirling snowflakes, had no idea where it might have ended up. He ought to be more careful. “Anyway…”</p>
<p class="para-p">They each took two of the small iron pellets he gave them. With his sling, Tahtay hit his pot the first time, sending it bouncing across the gravel of the Great Plaza. Kimimela missed, but not by much. Marcellinus drew back the elastic of his slingshot, aimed carefully…and also missed. “Getting the range,” he said apologetically.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay laughed and slung his second missile. It smacked into his original pot, breaking it into two pieces. This time Kimimela also hit her target fair and square, sending it skidding.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s second lead pellet slammed into the pot he was aiming for and shattered it into fragments.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Huh,” Tahtay said. Kimimela looked at Marcellinus in astonishment. Enopay tried unsuccessfully to cover a grin.</p>
<p class="para-p">They walked over and stared at the scattered wreckage of the pot. “And you’ll remember that I’m a terrible shot with a sling,” Marcellinus said, just to rub it in a little harder. “This is easier to aim. And did I mention that you don’t have to whirl it around your head?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay cleared his throat. “I can…borrow this for a day?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, I have four more,” Marcellinus said. “One for each of you.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Marcellinus had learned long before how the Cahokians had launched their Wakinyan from the ground during their attacks on the Roman fortresses of the Third Parthica and 27th Augustan on the banks of the Oyo. Tahtay and Kimimela had devised a winch with a large drum that was based on the original wood-and-steel wheels and gears that Marcellinus and his Ocatani artisans had created, along with a low wheeled cart capable of taking the weight of a fully crewed and loaded Thunderbird craft. This method had been tested on the Great Plaza of Cahokia, which was about as flat and level as any forum or marketplace in the Imperium, and implemented in action on carefully selected, almost manicured stretches of land to the north, east, and south of the Roman fortresses. Yet Tahtay and his launch teams had wrecked one of the Thunderbirds that night when its launch cart hit a rock, shattering a wheel just before the Wakinyan left the ground. The accident had killed two pilots outright and injured four more.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page285" title="285"/>
<p class="para-p">In the coming war, the allies could not rely on finding runways out in the Grass with the length and evenness necessary to launch the great birds. A more reliable method was required. Initially Marcellinus and Chenoa experimented with the idea of launching Wakinyan by using teams of horses the way the Mongols had launched their Firebirds at Yupkoyvi, but their results were nowhere near as gratifying.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Eagles were easier. With the Roman skill at constructing outsized siege engines, it was straightforward for the legion’s engineers to build an onager capable of throwing an Eagle into the air. And having achieved that, Roma flexed its engineering muscle even further. It was Marcellinus and Manius Ifer between them who came up with the winning suggestion for how to reliably launch a Wakinyan in war: a freestanding wooden tower 150 feet tall supported by wooden buttresses and steel and hemp cables, that could be carried to the battlefield in sections and assembled swiftly by dedicated and trained crews; a steel launch rail, also transported in sections, that could be fastened into place at the required angle, its top jutting out past the tower’s crest with its base at ground level; and a combination of a torsion mechanism and a heavy counterweight that dropped inside the tower to throw the Wakinyan aloft.</p>
<p class="para-p">The results were spectacular enough to be dangerous. The first Wakinyan launched from such a tower—fortunately uncrewed, with bags and weights in the place of pilots—ripped apart under the strain and plummeted to earth in several pieces, its wings stripped off by the ruthless acceleration.</p>
<p class="para-p">Chenoa, Sintikala, Marcellinus, and Ifer had to tune the mechanism, lighten the counterweight, and devise a system for unfurling and locking the outermost third of each Wakinyan wing once the bird was aloft to make the launch tower safe for human Thunderbird pilots. But once the design kinks were worked out, Marcellinus’s legionaries of the Sixth Ferrata built five more Wakinyan launch towers within two weeks. And after that it was simplicity itself to construct scaled-down versions of the tower and rail to launch Hawk and Eagle craft with greater force and stability than the onager-powered launches. For the first time, Cahokia’s aerial craft were truly transportable, at least with smart and well-trained centuries of soldiers to carry and construct the launch mechanisms.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page286" title="286"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was buoyed by the successes, his spirits soaring almost as high as the Thunderbirds. When you combined the ingenuity, industry, and inventive powers of Roma and Nova Hesperia, who could stand against them?</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">High above the Great Mound, Kimimela sparred in the air with Sooleawa, their two Hawks looping around each other so closely that they looked almost connected. Marcellinus, standing atop one of the new Wakinyan launch towers, was struck with a rare case of vertigo; he could look neither down through the wooden struts to the East Plaza far below him nor up into the sky where his daughter appeared to be flirting with death. These days he rarely feared for Sintikala. Her skill in the air was so assured, so uncanny, that it seemed impossible she could ever falter. His daughter was less experienced and more rash. On the ground Kimimela was infinitely distractible, often trying to do several things at once and doing none of them properly, and it was hard for Marcellinus to imagine that she would not have similar moments in the air, where a moment’s inattention could prove fatal.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Hidatsa headman and Blackfoot elders had left for home after two months in Cahokia, but the younger Blackfoot warriors had stayed at Tahtay’s invitation, and the Hidatsa buffalo caller at Sintikala’s. Sooleawa had taken to the air like a duck to water, achieving proficiency in just a few months in a way that gave the lie to Sintikala’s recent insistence that it would take Taianita two years to achieve the aerial competency required for war. Unlike Kimimela, Sooleawa was as totally focused in flight as she was in every other activity she pursued.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page287" title="287"/>
<p class="para-p">One of the smaller Wakinyan, with Taianita and Luyu among its seven-person crew, had just taken off from the tower on which Marcellinus was standing As it had streaked past him, just a couple of feet above his head, he had been watching the top of the rail. For some reason, in the final instants of contact the launching Thunderbirds were snagging and being jerked to the right, and Marcellinus could see no particular reason for that. Except, of course, that the whole tower swayed and almost seemed to crack like a whip as the weight of the Thunderbird went by, a disconcerting sensation when you were perched so high above the plaza. Marcellinus shook his head.</p>
<p class="para-p">Unexpectedly, Sintikala flew close by him on his right side. Startled, he grabbed the railing even though he was standing securely on the small platform. Sintikala’s laughter trailed behind her as she looped upward to chase after Taianita’s Wakinyan and pass it on the right.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sooleawa and Kimimela now parted company, soaring out and away from each other. Their Hawk wings were yellow-green in color with similar feathers on the wing edges and the physical builds of the two young women were comparable, but it was still easy to tell them apart in the air. Sooleawa flew her wing in a distinctive style, altering direction more quickly but much less smoothly than Kimimela and the others. Marcellinus imagined such agility and unpredictability would be an asset in battle, especially if the Mongols fired arrows or trebuchet bolts in an attempt to knock the Hesperian Hawks out of the skies.</p>
<p class="para-p">Although that possibility was something that he tried hard not to dwell on.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sooleawa lost height rapidly, spiraling down around the launch tower in broad loops and then using the speed she had gained to streak out in a straight line over the grass toward the exercising First Gallorum Cataphractaria. Watching, Marcellinus thought she would probably make it all the way over the heavy horsemen, though barely above helmet height, before she landed on the far side of them.</p>
<p class="para-p">She did not. Kicking her legs free, swinging vertically, she shoved the nose of her craft up in a stall even more dramatic than Sintikala would attempt, then somehow curled the nose of her Hawk around, spilled air and twisted, and landed on her feet.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page288" title="288"/>
<p class="para-p">She turned, walking quickly away from the cavalry with her wing still on her shoulders so that she would not interrupt their exercises. She was not wearing a flying tunic like the others; in fact, it looked like the same shapeless elk-skin dress she had been wearing at the Hidatsa camp when Marcellinus had first met her.</p>
<p class="para-p">Suddenly careless of the height, Marcellinus grabbed at the railing and leaned out to study the buffalo caller more closely. At that moment Sooleawa broke into a run, lifting her legs from the ground and coasting a few feet under the wing, then dropped and ran a little more, her dress flapping around her knees.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I know how she does it,” Marcellinus said aloud, and looked into the skies for the Wakinyan of Chenoa and Taianita, the Catanwakuwa of Sintikala. “Holy Juno…”</p>
<p class="para-p">As fast as he dared, he clambered down the ladder to the ground. He had an experiment he needed to try.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Marcellinus caught up to them later, as the sun was lowering toward the horizon and sending gold and silver through the snow-streaked grass. Sintikala and Chenoa stared intently at each other and talked of craft and pilots while Demothi, Taianita, Sooleawa, Kimimela, Luyu, and four or five other Hawk and Thunderbird clan members strolled behind, gossiping in a much more relaxed way. He hurried to Sintikala’s side. “I know how she did it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Chenoa looked at him blankly, irritated at the interruption. Sintikala raised an eyebrow. “How who did what?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sooleawa, at the buffalo jump. I know how she threw herself off the cliff and lived.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She grinned. “So long, it has taken you? Why do you think I was so eager to make a Hawk of her?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“But it’s more important than that. We can use it.” Marcellinus pulled a square of cotton from his pocket. “What happens if your Hawk wing breaks?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page289" title="289"/>
<p class="para-p">“I mend it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Breaks in the air, I mean. Up high.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Chenoa looked impatient. “It does not happen, Gaius Wanageeska. We build our wings well. We test them close to the ground and fly them with care.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“But in war you will be under fire from the Mongols.” Marcellinus unwrapped the cotton. He had attached sinew to each corner and connected the threads to a small piece of wood. To the wood he had fastened a little stone, as the wood itself was not heavy enough. “How do leaves hit the ground? Hard, like ballista balls?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala shook her head, bemused. “Gaius, Chenoa and I have important matters to discuss. Tomorrow your Praetors want us to take—”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus scrunched up the cotton and threw the rock as hard as he could. It arced up, and then the cotton opened behind it, slowing it. Arrested in its trajectory through the air, the rock swung beneath the fabric and drifted down toward the grass.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sky Lantern, plus Hawk wing, makes falling leaf,” he said. He couldn’t think of a better way of explaining it.</p>
<p class="para-p">Both women stopped. Chenoa blinked and frowned. Sintikala watched as the rock came to earth and the cotton square crumpled down onto it. “Hmm.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Falling leaf,” he said again. “Perhaps with you as the rock.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala turned. “Sooleawa? Come here, please. Now.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“It is sacred,” Sooleawa said obstinately. “Sacred to the hunt. Sacred to the people. It is between me and the buffalo, and I shall not speak of it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“All right.” Marcellinus addressed Sintikala instead. “But that is how I think such a thing <em class="char-i">might</em> be done. At the buffalo jump Sooleawa’s clothing was not a wing and she did not fly, but its billowing helped keep her straight and arrest her fall just enough that she did not smash herself on the rocks below. Like one of the flying squirrels we see in the forests. And perhaps long enough for Blackfoot men beneath to hold out what, a big blanket?”</p>
<p class="para-p">No one answered. Sooleawa’s face was set as if in stone.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page290" title="290"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus shook his head. “It doesn’t matter.” He would love to know for sure, but Sooleawa’s face was a mask and Chenoa was scowling, and he knew he was treading on sensitive territory. He tried another angle. “When I fly in the Wakinyan, the air sometimes catches in my clothes and drags the wing back, unbalancing it. This is why you and Kimi wear the tighter tunics when you fly. When sailing ships come into the wind, they are slowed; they can even stop dead in the water and then be blown back. And when Sooleawa turns in the air so fast, it is because she is cupping the air in her clothing. It billows. She is used to that because she is skilled in leaping from high places. She has trained for that, and so she instinctively uses the same technique when she flies.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus threw the rock into the air again, and again it floated back down to the ground. “The rock comes down slowly because of the air that catches in the cotton. It…buoys the cotton, I suppose. And so, Sintikala, if you carry a much larger square of cotton when you fly, if your wing is shot away, you <em class="char-i">may</em> not die when you fall out of the sky.”</p>
<p class="para-p">There was a long silence. Nobody looked at him.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Go now,” Sintikala said eventually. “We will speak of this alone, we women of the land.”</p>
<p class="para-p">About to protest, Marcellinus saw the warning look in her eye. “All right,” he muttered. He picked up his rock and cotton and walked away, leaving the Hesperians to talk.</p>
<p class="para-p">Safely away from them, he threw it into the air once again with all the force he could muster. Once again, the air in the cotton slowed the rock in flight and it came drifting down to drop into the sand of the Great Plaza. It was a little jerky. Perhaps, like the Sky Lantern bags, it needed a small hole in the middle.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus eyed it thoughtfully. If the buffalo caller needed to preserve the secrets of her hunting ritual, that was fine with him. The pull of the cotton against the air was the important thing. He could work with that.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then he glanced at the sun. He was due back at his legionary headquarters at sundown to meet with his tribunes and primus pilus about the military maneuvers in the Grass the next day. And the fortress of the Sixth was four miles away, on the other side of the river. “Futete.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page291" title="291"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus snatched up his toy Falling Leaf and broke into a run. He would certainly get his exercise today.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">His life with his new legion was far from easy. Marcellinus had changed a great deal over the last ten years in Nova Hesperia. It was not that he had forgotten how to lead Romans; after most of a lifetime spent in military service, the old ways of speaking and acting, even his body language and demeanor, had come right back with little difficulty. But Marcellinus had learned a great deal about family and community during his time in Cahokia, and the martial environment of the Fortress of the Thunderbolt was no longer entirely to his taste.</p>
<p class="para-p">His men of the Legio VI Ferrata respected and obeyed him. Even before the Mongol attack in the gulf, they had suffered hugely in Nova Hesperia. Half of the Sixth had been on this Hesperian campaign for seven years now, in a blazing hot and dank environment for most of each year. Hostile head-hunting tribes had surrounded them in the long peninsula where they first had landed, and the longboats of the People of the Sun had never been far away. But over and above their difficulties with the climate, tribes, and sheer duration of the campaign, Calidius Verus had been a capricious leader.</p>
<p class="para-p">Manius Ifer, in contrast, was a skilled engineer and strategist, and although he had received some challenging missions, he had been treated well in camp and his men had been given sufficient time to recover between tours of duty.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then, of course, had come the shock of the Mongol assault and their long voyage up the Mizipi against its terrible current, all the while knowing that they were cut off from the rest of the Roman presence in Nova Hesperia. The legionaries of the Sixth were exhausted, and grateful to Marcellinus for leading them out of hell.</p>
<p class="para-p">But things were looking up. Their new Fortress of the Thunderbolt was solid, close to other legions, and close to a sizable city of local allies. The stormiest times in the Roman-Cahokian alliance had taken place long before the arrival of the Sixth. It was notable that the foot soldiers of the Ironclads were already more relaxed around the Cahokians than were the troops of Sabinus’s and Agrippa’s legions. This was, of course, encouraged by Marcellinus and reinforced by the joint exercises between the Sixth Ferrata and the First, Second, and Third Cahokian Cohorts.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page292" title="292"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s private feelings about the Sixth Ferrata remained mixed. During their perilous trip upriver Marcellinus had believed his time with the Sixth was temporary. He had thus been able to overlook or suppress his dire memories from Ocatan, where the quinqueremes of the Sixth had stormed its gates and laid waste to the city, slaying warriors and innocents alike and mistreating the survivors in the aftermath. Marcellinus would sometimes meet the eyes of a young legionary in the streets of his fortress and wonder how many Ocatani lives that soldier had taken. Might he even be one of the men who had beaten Marcellinus so grievously on the Ocatani Temple Mound?</p>
<p class="para-p">It should have been no greater than the dissonance he had experienced and ultimately overcome when befriending Cahokians who had defeated and slaughtered his Romans of the 33rd. But his bonds with Hurit and Anapetu had been closer than his attachments to, say, Aelfric or Pollius Scapax, and his pain at their loss had been more visceral.</p>
<p class="para-p">Truth be told, Marcellinus’s heart now lived with his Hesperian friends rather than his Roman troops. Nonetheless he gave it his best shot, sometimes impassive to a fault and at other times wearing a smile on his lips that was not quite reflected in his eyes.</p>
<p class="para-p">However, Marcellinus remained steadfast. He <em class="char-i">did</em> want to lead the Sixth against the Mongols. He <em class="char-i">did</em> want to wreak havoc among the hordes of the Mongol Khan while minimizing the carnage on the Roman and Cahokian side. War was his profession, and he would conduct it to the best of his ability. His comfort was not the issue. He had a job to do.</p>
<p class="para-p">And it was quite a job. In addition to restoring confidence to the Legio VI Ferrata, Marcellinus had some new skills to learn. For most of his career he had served in legions composed mostly of infantry. Yet now he was preparing for warfare on the Great Plains of Nova Hesperia against an enemy army of mounted horsemen, as part of a force that included a substantial number of heavy and light cavalry units.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page293" title="293"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus needed to know how to command cavalry, and he spent many evenings talking with Sabinus and Aelfric, with the tribunes who led the alae, and with the decurions of individual turmae. He devoted considerable time in the depths of that winter to soaking up horse lore, studying the history of great cavalry actions, and speaking with Hadrianus, Sabinus, and Agrippa about their prior experiences fighting the Mongol armies. Above all, Marcellinus endured a number of long days in the saddle, exercising with the troopers and learning to think like a leader of cavalry as well as infantry.</p>
<p class="para-p">Taking into account the complexity of the coalition forces arrayed under the Imperator’s command; the multitude of peoples and approaches, terrains, conditions, and logistic issues; and even the climate of Nova Hesperia, the fast-approaching war against the Mongol Khan without doubt would be the most challenging of Marcellinus’s career.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“Are you all right?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus raised his head. Kimimela stood at the foot of the Mound of the Chiefs, looking up at him. “Hello, Kimi. Yes.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She hesitated. “I was worried. You haven’t even moved for so long. I will leave you to talk.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was alone on the mound but grateful that he did not need to explain why he was sitting there. “I have said all I needed to say.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Did you hear anything in return?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela was serious. Cahokians did not joke about communing with the dead, and Marcellinus would not make light of it either. “Great Sun Man has no words for me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">It was later than he had thought. Time had gotten away from him. He looked north across the Great Plaza at the Master Mound on its opposite side, then at the Mound of the Hawks next to him where the Cahokians buried their wise men and inventors. Kimimela was daughter to Sintikala, and Sintikala was daughter to the man who had served Cahokia as war chief before Great Sun Man. That man, too, was buried in the mound beneath him.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page294" title="294"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was almost literally sitting on Kimimela’s grandfather. It was an odd notion. “Did you want to come up?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“If you want to be alone a while longer, I will leave you. Will you come to my mother’s house tonight, or do you go to Roma?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Roma,” Marcellinus said with regret. “Come up, Kimi. Perhaps I can hear the wisdom of Great Sun Man and the ancients through you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I doubt it. But I will try to help.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela knelt and placed her forehead on the ground, paying her respects to the mound and the chiefs buried within, just as Marcellinus had before setting foot on the mound’s sacred slope. She stood and turned away, murmuring some words under her breath, then slowly climbed the cedar steps. “I have not been here for a very long time.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Nor have I.” The last time Marcellinus had set foot on this mound was to slay an Iroqua captive for Great Sun Man in Tahtay’s place. He had come to the mound’s base since then to pay his respects to Great Sun Man in death, but this was the first time he had felt moved to sit on its slopes.</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela sat down by his side. “Tomorrow you leave for Forward Camp.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Again you leave Cahokia.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes. It is spring, and time for war.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Always, now, it is time for war.”</p>
<p class="para-p">That was irrefutable, and Marcellinus made no comment.</p>
<p class="para-p">“We will come along, too, in just a few more days.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She and Sintikala and the rest of the Hawks. Marcellinus would march with his Sixth Ferrata along the banks of the Wemissori to the confluence where the Braided River joined it. His cohorts would be guarding a wagon train of fifty of the new Cahokian wagons. The four-wheeled wagons were each capable of carrying 3,500 pounds of supplies, and the new Roman road they would follow along the bank was even and mostly level. The wagons were covered with tall canvas hoods, pulled by mules, and steered by Cahokian and Iroqua drivers. At Forward Camp they would arrive at a castra twice the area of the fortresses by the Mizipi’s banks but much more rudimentary, surrounded by a Hesperian camp within an earthen rampart and ditch. Pulled up to the banks alongside Forward Camp would be longships and quinqueremes. And reaching off to the south and north would be the string of fortlets that made up the Line of Hadrianus. Forward Camp was around four hundred miles from Cahokia, and the march there would take the Sixth a little over two weeks.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page295" title="295"/>
<p class="para-p">Most of the Hawk clan would follow aboard the quinqueremes <em class="char-i">Minerva</em> and <em class="char-i">Fides</em>, its pilots helping to row, taking shifts with the Roman oarsmen. The upper decks of both ships would be covered with Hawk and Thunderbird wings and the disassembled launch towers. On the banks alongside would come another line of Cahokian covered wagons, carrying other equipment.</p>
<p class="para-p">The plan had always been to face the Mongols far from Cahokia, on terrain of the Romans’ choosing. Fighting with the Mizipi at their backs would be a significant tactical disadvantage, in addition to exposing the Great City and the Roman bases there to unacceptable risk. Much better to march forward and meet the Mongol Horde out in the Grass from a well-supplied advance position.</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela appraised him. “Are you strong?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Certainly.” Marcellinus trained regularly with his daughter. She would know already that he was muscled, healthy, still lightning quick with a sword.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yet you are worried.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He did not answer.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I love you,” Kimimela said unexpectedly. “And not just because you taught me and not just because you are husband to my mother. I love you for <em class="char-i">you</em>. Sternly. Fiercely.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus felt inadequate to respond. He put his right arm around her and pressed his left hand into the dirt of the mound by his side to grasp the grass, his knuckles white. She was so precious to him. He was risking so much. They all were.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page296" title="296"/>
<p class="para-p">“Thank you,” he said.</p>
<p class="para-p">She leaned into him. “I wish that we were not going to war.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He nodded. “I, too.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I fear that perhaps you are thinking you are broken. That you cannot do this. But I think you can. With our help.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He was mute.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Enopay told me a funny story,” she said. “Enopay, who is in love-and-love with everything Roman, and who I sometimes think is even more Roman than you are.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Now Marcellinus grinned. “I’ve thought that, too. Ships, soldiers, aqueducts, basilicas. Enopay wants all the things he has not seen. One day he—”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela elbowed him gently to cut him off. “Enopay told me that when a Roman Imperator or one of his Praetors is awarded a great military triumph in Urbs Roma, as he leads his procession through the streets lined with marble, a word slave stands behind him in his cart and keeps telling him he is no god but a man, that he is weak and puny and will one day die like every other man.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“He does not <em class="char-i">lead</em> the procession…” Marcellinus stopped. The details were not important. “So you have come to stand behind me as you used to stand behind Tahtay? To tell me to breathe and stop being an idiot or you’ll smack my head?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Something like that.” Kimimela hesitated. “You will laugh at this, Gaius. But sometimes I worry that you are not yet a man.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He looked sideways at her.</p>
<p class="para-p">“To Roma, you are. But here in Hesperia, perhaps you are not yet a man in your soul.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus wondered if he should tell her. She looked up into his eyes. “Oh, I know my mother’s blood flows within you. And that your blood beats in her heart, too. She told me. And I love it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He should have guessed that she would know. “For me, that was the moment when I became a little less Roman.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You seem no less Roman to the rest of us. Now more than ever. And my mother’s blood is strong, but perhaps for this coming war you will need more than that.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page297" title="297"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus knew about the rites of passage for young Cahokian males. He did not intend to go through such a thing himself. “You bled when you became a woman. I think I have done enough bleeding since I arrived in Cahokia for any man.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I must tell you of the day I thought you had died,” Kimimela said very seriously. “The day Mahkah rode back into Cahokia almost dead himself on a horse that could barely walk, and told us that your expedition had been wiped out by Mongols who appeared suddenly in a place you could not possibly have expected them.” She looked at him. “I will not tell you how my mother took the news. That is for her to tell if she has not already. But part of her died inside on that day, and I thought she might never speak again, to me or to anyone else. And so I put on my Hawk wing and told Demothi to shoot me up into the air at dusk. He understood, and did not try to stop me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You don’t need to tell me this,” he said, suddenly afraid.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, I do. When Demothi cast me up over the Great Mound, I almost did not spread my wings.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus could not help but picture it: a ball of deerskin and frail wooden spars arcing over Cahokia, with Kimimela curled up inside it. Curving down toward the ground. He shivered. “But you did.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I feared for the people beneath me if I came crashing down on them, and I decided to feel the air upon my skin one more time. I opened up the wing and saw the fires of the city far below me. I started to fly with the wind, toward the sunset. Toward the southwest where I knew you were. But now I flew blindly. I saw nothing. A long time seemed to pass.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The chill spread across Marcellinus’s neck, temples, and forehead. Flying blind, until she crashed and died. He reached out, took her hand.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I thought that if you were dead and Roma was here, then I would go to be with you in death. I was lost in the dark of the air, and then I opened my eyes one last time. I was still much higher than I had thought I would be, and alongside me an owl was flying. A real bird. I knew the owl was there for me, watching over me as we flew. And so I landed safely and began to walk home. I slept, woke, slept again, and then came back to Cahokia the next noon. I had flown far, and in the flying I had learned that I was a true Hawk after all and that it was time to live.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page298" title="298"/>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela had been on her spirit journey, just as Tahtay had. In her own mind, it had made her fully an adult. She turned to him. “To you, my mother is Sintikala and also Sisika. To me, you are also many men in one man. You are the Wanageeska. Gaius. A Roman Praetor. And also my father.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And yet one of those men is not a man in his soul?” Marcellinus said, still mildly rankled.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I am Kimimela. I am a butterfly who flies like a hawk, whose spirit is the owl. Tahtay is of the Fox clan, and his spirit is the wolf, and he is also Mingan of the Blackfoot and a Fire Heart, and one day if he lives he will take the name of his father and become Great Sun Man of Cahokia. As for Enopay, he was born a man. He popped out of his mother’s womb already an adult in a baby’s body. That is why his birth was her death. Enopay does not need to find his path, because he knows it already. Perhaps he needs no spirit animal.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“A duck, perhaps, or a fish,” Marcellinus said. “I have never known a boy who loves the water and ships as Enopay does.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela frowned. Perhaps this was a blasphemous or disrespectful thing for Marcellinus to suggest. He did not know. She was a shock to him, this earnest and thoughtful young woman. He was at the same time touched by her seriousness and emotion and disconcerted by her story and her sudden mysticism. Now Kimimela looked up into his eyes. “You are not just who you were born, Gaius. None of us is. You are who you become. You should know this, you above anyone, Praetor Wanageeska Gaius Hotah Marcellinus Eyanosa of the Raven clan and the Sixth.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And so?” Marcellinus asked. Did he need yet another name? Another brush with death, this time with a meaningful animal nearby?</p>
<p class="para-p">“Be open,” Kimimela said. “Open to everything about the land. Perhaps you can never truly be one of us. Our rites and journeys may not be for you. But be open, just in case. Do not step back and become fully Roman again.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page299" title="299"/>
<p class="para-p">He thought about it. “No. That is not what I want, to become fully Roman again.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And what do you want?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“To have fewer names,” he said slowly, and looked down at her. “To be your father. Sintikala’s husband. And a friend to Tahtay and Enopay. In a Cahokia without Roma.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Now she grinned. “And that is what we all want, too. So do not be killed by Mongols, Gaius.” It was an echo of what a much younger Kimimela had once begged him long before: <em class="char-i">Do not be killed by Iroqua, Gaius</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">He saw Sintikala in her face and in her eyes. She had her mother’s fierceness, stubbornness, and strength. Yet Kimimela was very much her own person, with a playfulness and wicked humor that Sintikala rarely achieved.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus loved Sintikala with an intensity that dwarfed any battle ardor he had ever experienced. His love for Kimimela was gentler and more protective but just as intense. He would die for either one of them.</p>
<p class="para-p">He had no doubt that Kimimela loved him just as strongly. After all, she had almost died for him. The thought still chilled him to his core, and to compensate he pretended to brush off her fear for him with humor. “Oh, very well. If you insist, I shall attempt to survive.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Be sure you do.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And when did you become so wise?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Airily she said, “Oh, I was born wise. And strong. But I needed you and Sintikala to help me step into it and know it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She moved away from him and touched the surface of the ground with the palms of both hands. From her sudden absorption, Marcellinus knew he should not disturb her.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then she stood up and turned to him, her face serious again. “Gaius Marcellinus. I will always be with you. Sometimes in the air. Sometimes not. But always standing behind you, whispering: <em class="char-i">Live</em>.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He nodded. She rested one hand on his shoulder for a moment, then her lip turned upward in that Sintikala-like quick grin and she walked away, down the steps of the mound.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page300" title="300"/>
<p class="para-p">Well. His daughter was growing up.</p>
<p class="para-p">He had been so close to death, so often. Never had he been in such danger of dying within the month.</p>
<p class="para-p">Never had he wanted so much to live.</p>
<p class="para-p">But he did not think the answer to that lay with the gods, whether Roman or Cahokian. He needed no Roman gods, no lares. Even more, he needed no vision quest in the Hesperian style. That was for the Cahokians, and regardless of what Kimimela might say, their culture was not truly his. Marcellinus needed no animal of the spirit to guide him unless it was the eagle, by which he again meant the Aquila of Roma just as surely as the eagles of Hesperia.</p>
<p class="para-p">For Marcellinus it was enough to have family, true family at last, after all these years. Yet…</p>
<p class="para-p">“I will try to live, Kimi.” Marcellinus paused and thought and spoke aloud the words that were on his lips and in his heart despite all their inherent contradictions. “By the gods of your people and mine, I will try very hard indeed.”</p></div></body></html>

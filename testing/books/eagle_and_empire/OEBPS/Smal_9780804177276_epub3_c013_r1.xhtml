<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">T</span>hree days later the Kicka River spit the knarr out into the Mizipi and into the middle of a Roman flotilla.</p>
<p class="para-p">Below the convergence of the Kicka and the Mizipi was a quinquereme that was being led by a Norse drekar. Just passing out of sight around the bend upriver of them was a second quinquereme. In between were a trireme and another Norse dragon ship.</p>
<p class="para-p">The knarr’s rejoining the convoy was announced by a deafening blast of Roman horns. The warships ahead and behind acknowledged the signal with brief cornu blasts of their own.</p>
<p class="para-p">The wind was westerly, and the knarr had lost weigh in turning north. It swung in behind one of the drekars, which threw it a line. Marcellinus and the Hesperians boarded the drekar while Ifer took Bassus to the nearest quinquereme—the <em class="char-i">Clementia</em>—to see a naval medicus.</p>
<p class="para-p">The quinquereme ahead of them was the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>, which hung back and waited for them to catch up. The <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> was the newest and best maintained of the great Roman galleys of the Sixth Ferrata, and served as the flagship.</p>
<p class="para-p">And there on the poop deck, highly visible in his white Praetor’s crest, was Calidius Verus. “Large as life and twice as fat,” the Chitimachan muttered. Marcellinus grimaced but could not find it in himself to scold her for her disrespect.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page191" title="191"/>
<p class="para-p">As the drekar approached, one of the sailors threw a rope ladder over the side. “Just you,” said the ship’s master from the deck, easily recognizable by his fringed cloak and mushroom-tipped staff. “The rest of ’em can stay where they are. We don’t wish bad luck on the Praetor’s flagship by bringing redskin women and children aboard. We’ll find ’em berths on another ship later.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked at the faces of his remaining crew: Enopay, Hanska, Taianita, and the Chitimachan. Even after getting on one another’s nerves for months mostly spent on a painfully small raft, it was surprisingly difficult to be parted from them. “I’m sorry. I’ll be back soon.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hand over hand, he climbed the rope ladder. The top deck was disconcertingly high, but as soon as his head came level with the bulwark, two Roman sailors grabbed his arms to haul him aboard.</p>
<p class="para-p">Verus looked him over. “Well, well. Gaius Publius Marcellinus. You appear to have fallen upon hard times.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was surely a dirty and disreputable sight. He saluted. “Indeed, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And what of the four turmae of the Second Aravacorum, in whose company I last saw you?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Lost outside Yupkoyvi, central city of the People of the Hand,” Marcellinus said. “Defeated in battle by an expeditionary force of the Mongol Khan under the leadership of his general Jebei Noyon.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Verus looked startled. “They sought you out directly?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“In a way. They were evidently making their return from the southern isthmus of Nova Hesperia after portaging their fleet when they got wind of us.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus stared into the eyes of his fellow Praetor, his expression cold, quite ready to turn and climb back down the ladder to his friends rather than face criticism from this man. But Verus stepped forward and clapped him on the arm, ushering him away from the listening ears of the crew. “Regrettable, sir, quite regrettable. But believe me, I am suddenly well acquainted with military disaster. We do what we can for our men, sir, we do indeed, but no good commander should berate himself for defeat provided that he has done his best.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page192" title="192"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus, whose feelings on such matters were rather different, maintained a studied silence. Unseen on the decks below them, the oarsmen dug deep and the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> surged forward up the Mizipi. Marcellinus did not glance back at the drekar for fear of seeing Enopay’s face, which was undoubtedly forlorn at being abandoned.</p>
<p class="para-p">Calidius Verus was still speaking. “These Mongol bastards are unbelievably thorough. Coldhearted butchers. Maniacs. Believe me, we only survived by abandoning the fortress and retreating out into the Mare Solis.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded and made no comment.</p>
<p class="para-p">“It was not the time or the place to engage,” Verus continued. “This is a brown-water navy with largely riverine expertise. The Rhine, the Euphrates; hardly at their best on the high seas, with the tides and tows and all. We had not trained for such an action, had never expected one.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Just so,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Verus looked grim. “The Mongols aim to kill the legions one by one. Yes? Bottle up the Legio VI Ferrata, keep us separate from the main force, and then split the men on the Line of Hadrianus off from Cahokia and the Chesapica. That will not hold. This time we engage; this time we go through. The Hesperian Nile is Roman now, and <em class="char-i">we</em> will control it. Not the redskins and definitely not the slant-eyes.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked at the Praetor in open disbelief. “What?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We will hammer them. We must pass through their blockade to rejoin our comrades in the north, but we must also do as much damage to the Khan’s bastards as possible.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Those are two different military objectives,” Marcellinus said. “Which is our primary goal? To pass through or to defeat the Mongol fleet so that Roma regains control of the Mizipi?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“They’re one and the same.” Verus inspected him. “And as for you, man, how on earth did you manage to escape from the Khan’s clutches?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We did not escape,” Marcellinus said. “We were released. The Khan slew the soldiers but spared the commanders, as he has done many times in the Asian theater. Freed us so that we could bring stories of his ruthless victories to the Imperator. He hopes to damage morale.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page193" title="193"/>
<p class="para-p">Verus looked back to the Norse dragon ship, which was falling astern. “Well, at least he’s a gentleman in that regard. Yet I also see Cahokians among the ranks of the saved.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes. Hanska’s valor saved her. She impressed the Khan with her bravery and strength. And Pezi is lost to us, enslaved by the Khan, but his words helped save the other translators.” Marcellinus paused, but honesty forced him to admit it. “Without Pezi, things may have gone even worse. Your faith in him was not misplaced.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Praetor smiled. “I pride myself on being a good judge of character. I suspected you would find him satisfactory. For a barbarian, Pezi has some fine qualities. Trapped with the Khan’s forces now? I regret that and wish him well.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Indeed, sir. And as for you, in the gulf…Forgive me, but how many legionaries did you lose in that action?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Verus shrugged. “Two thousand? We have been rather too busy to count. But come: to be frank, you seem in need of a drink, and by Jove, it’s long past the time I usually start. The Mongols may have robbed me of my fortress and a few galleys, but I did ensure I salvaged my best Falernian wines. Please, come below to my cabin and let us talk further over a cup or two.”</p>
<p class="para-p">All of a sudden, Marcellinus could bear it no longer. “Praetor Verus, I regret that there is another matter that I must first bring to your attention.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“About your expedition to the southwest?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No, sir. It concerns your old friend Lucius Domitius Corbulo. I find myself unable to keep you in the dark any longer.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Calidius Verus had become very still. “Pray continue, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus paused, but there was really nothing for it: the truth must be spoken.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Corbulo mutinied against my command. It happened upon our arrival in Cahokia, before the battle in which the 33rd was defeated. And I believe he conspired to have me murdered before that by Magyar auxiliaries while we trekked westward from the Mare Chesapica. Certainly such auxiliaries were by his side when he attempted to slay me.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page194" title="194"/>
<p class="para-p">Verus said nothing but examined Marcellinus carefully, as if seeing him for the first time.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus took a deep breath. “I regret to inform you that in the fight that broke out subsequent to his attempt to depose me from Praetorship of the 33rd, Lucius Domitius Corbulo died at my hands.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Verus took a step back. His hand dropped to the hilt of his gladius. “Are you mad, sir?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Never more sane,” Marcellinus said steadily. “And I exhort you, sir, to leave your sword where it is. I am in no mood for…unpleasantness.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The moment expanded. Marcellinus became aware that the chatter of conversation from the soldiers on the top deck had become muted but did not take his eye off Praetor Verus. Marcellinus’s only weapon was a pugio, and it was under his tunic. He would have no time to draw it if Verus attacked him; unless he could quickly disarm Verus with a kick to his wrist, his only sane course of action would be to run and leap bodily off the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> into the Mizipi.</p>
<p class="para-p">Calidius Verus leaned forward. “You are a traitor, a fratricide, and a redskin lover. If you did not have the trust of the Imperator, I would slay you here and now, sir. I would indeed.”</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">Fratricide?</em> Marcellinus let it lie. “I understand.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You will leave my flagship immediately. We shall not speak again.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Glad to, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus backed away slowly and went to talk to the master of the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> to signal the dragon ship.</p>
<p class="para-p">He was very sure he was not a traitor to Roma. But as for “redskin lover,” Marcellinus would feel infinitely better once he was away from the loathsome Verus and back in the company of his friends.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The fleet proceeded north.</p>
<p class="para-p">By the best estimates of Titus Otho, ship’s master of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>, Shappa Ta’atan was five days away at a normal rowing speed. However, they were not proceeding apace; the legionaries, sailors, and marines were preparing for battle, and a key part of those preparations was to ensure that the men were rested and ready. To break a blockade and fight a naval engagement, the oarsmen might need to row at top speed for extended intervals. Such an effort would require them to be in peak condition.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page195" title="195"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was not briefed on the plan of attack. He had not spoken to Verus since being dismissed from the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>, and for all his politeness and apparent respect, Titus Otho chose not to share his orders with Marcellinus. The limit of Marcellinus’s own preparation was to ensure that he and all his Hesperians were armed with the best weapons available and that Hanska was provided with twice as many as she could reasonably use.</p>
<p class="para-p">The oarsmen and marines on board were fleet soldiers, not slaves or freedmen, and the sailors were specialists from the Roman navy. Marcellinus saw sailors on these ships from Sardinia, Pannonia, and Illyria-Dalmatia, distinctive as always in their thick wool tunics of iron gray, the seaman’s color, with blue scarves, Phrygian caps, and cloth sash belts. Despite Verus’s allegations that they were untrained, to Marcellinus they appeared quite competent.</p>
<p class="para-p">“So how many Roman troops in all?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay was doing his best to wash the sweat off his face and arms, using a pail of muddy water he had just hauled up from the Mizipi at the end of a long rope. He would end up dirtier than he had started, albeit cooler. A gladius and small shield lay by his side. To the amusement of the legionaries on the top deck of the <em class="char-i">Providentia,</em> he had just been sparring with Hanska, who was now leaning on the bulwark staring morosely upriver, having barely broken a sweat during their training.</p>
<p class="para-p">Unlike the legionaries, Marcellinus did not mock Enopay and would never laugh at anyone trying to better himself. But he hoped beyond hope that Enopay would never face an enemy in close combat. The boy had little coordination, and a short reach. He moved quickly and had a ready store of dirty tricks absorbed from Taianita and Hanska, but any Mongol warrior would make short work of him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Of course, there was no guarantee any of them would survive this. From the best guess of the sailors aboard the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> who had fought the Mongol fleet in the gulf, they faced a force of some thirty Mongol and Jin battle junks, with help from as many as twenty large wooden canoes of the northwestern Tlingit tribe and an unknown number of longboats of the Yokot’an Maya. Although smaller than the Roman quinqueremes, the Mongol junks would be swift and maneuverable and would surely carry full complements of black powder weapons.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page196" title="196"/>
<p class="para-p">“How many of us?” Enopay shook his arms, and water droplets scattered across the deck in front of him. “I have not seen into every Roman vessel. But with six quinqueremes each loaded with five hundred troops, two triremes, four dragon ships, and the men we have seen in the five knarrs, we probably have three and a half thousands.” He rubbed his face and grimaced at the taste of the Mizipi water on his lips. “But we will be going upriver and will need all the speed we can muster. Most of our troops will be rowing like fuck, not fighting.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus winced. “Enopay, just because you are surrounded by Romans does not mean you should curse like one.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sorry. Anyway, at most only fifteen hundreds of us will be free to fight.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And the Mongol fleet?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Can I see around bends in the Mizipi? I cannot. But the men say the battle junks have crews of perhaps fifty apiece, and there may be thirty of them in all. If the long canoes of the Tlingit each have sixty men and there are twenty canoes and”—he shrugged—“say, eight longboats of the Sun, they will have a little over three thousands of men in total. Given that the Mongols have the advantage of the current, the battle may be very close.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We should get you ashore beforehand,” Marcellinus said. “You, the Chitimachan, Taianita.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You would have us walk to Cahokia from here? If Roma breaks the blockade, we will get to Cahokia quicker with you than on foot. If not, we would still have an army between us and the Great City. And…” Enopay shook his head.</p>
<p class="para-p">“What?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page197" title="197"/>
<p class="para-p">“And if you are gone as well as my grandfather, perhaps I do not want to return to Cahokia anyway.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus opened his mouth, closed it again.</p>
<p class="para-p">“However much you might try, I do not think you can protect me from this war,” Enopay said matter-of-factly. “Shall we eat again? We are both still very thin.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The last time Marcellinus had seen the Legio VI Ferrata surge into battle, he had been on the receiving end of it, surrounded by the unfortunate populace of Ocatan as it was assaulted by seven quinqueremes of the Ironclads. Now he stood aboard one of the same quinqueremes with a Roman helmet strapped to his head and a scutum bearing the thunderbolt insignia of the VI Ferrata on his left arm. Once again, though, he was flanked by Hesperians: around him were Hanska, Taianita, the Chitimachan, and Enopay, all clutching Roman weapons with varying degrees of confidence.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Roman fleet was powering upriver in formation. Leading the pack were the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> and the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em>, rowing side by side, separated by fifty yards. Both quinqueremes had onagers on their middecks primed and ready for action. Both also had their fighting towers erected fore and aft and a battery of scorpios lining their bulwarks. A scorpio was a one-man ballista, a torsion-sprung crossbow seven feet across mounted on a post five feet high, which fired stout bolts of iron and wood five feet long. Similar but slightly larger was the harpax, a ballista that shot a combination of a harpoon and a grappling iron on a cable, enabling the quinquereme to spear and reel in an enemy ship for boarding. Each quinquereme possessed two of the harpax ballistae, at bow and stern.</p>
<p class="para-p">Following the lead quinqueremes were two dragon ships each a hundred feet long. After them came another pair of quinqueremes, the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>, on which Marcellinus and his friends now stood, and the <em class="char-i">Fides</em>, both also bristling with legionaries at arms and with their fighting turrets set for battle. In their wake came the cargo vessel known as the <em class="char-i">Annona</em>, the two triremes, four smaller drekars, and five knarrs.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page198" title="198"/>
<p class="para-p">Bringing up the rear were the older quinqueremes, <em class="char-i">Minerva</em> and <em class="char-i">Clementia</em>. The <em class="char-i">Minerva</em> had been in splendid condition when it had taken Marcellinus and the others downriver the previous year but was now substantially damaged from the Mongol attack. The scorch marks on its bow and all down its port side made it appear that the ship had taken a vicious black eye. The <em class="char-i">Clementia</em> was in better shape, with only minimal damage and a freshly painted bow, but was serving as the fleet’s hospital ship. Every Roman naval vessel had a medicus or two aboard, but the <em class="char-i">Clementia</em> held a dedicated sick bay to care for those seriously wounded in the earlier battle. The galley was thus short of fighting men, and might need additional defense if any could be spared.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sir?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, Hanska?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Good luck.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He nodded. “And to you, warrior.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She cocked an eye at him. “Oh, and sir? Don’t force me to jump in and save your life again. That would just be embarrassing for both of us.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus grinned. “Noted. But should the opportunity arise, please feel free to save Enopay’s.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’ll do that, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Across the fifty yards that separated him from the <em class="char-i">Fides</em>, Marcellinus could see the centurion Manius Ifer standing next to the <em class="char-i">Fides</em>’s master with his hands clasped behind his back in a pose of complete calm and confidence. Marcellinus had learned recently that Ifer had been promoted to tribune pro tem of the Tenth Cohort. The appointment did not surprise him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus could not see Calidius Verus in the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> from this far behind, but he certainly hoped the Praetor owned a bearing as calm as Manius Ifer’s. For now they were rounding the last bend in the river that separated them from Shappa Ta’atan. A deafening blast of horns from the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> was taken up quickly by the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em>. From belowdecks on the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> they heard a smattering of cheers from the three ranks of oarsmen beneath their feet. The drums that set the time for the rowers, however, did not increase their tempo, and the hortator who commanded them was swearing at the crew to maintain their current rhythm. “Not yet, you sons of whores, not yet…”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page199" title="199"/>
<p class="para-p">The ranks of marines and legionaries on the top deck in front of Marcellinus stood stolid, saving their breath, waiting for the fray. But Marcellinus could sense their energy and determination building. As they propelled themselves upriver into the dragon’s maw, anticipation was rising.</p>
<p class="para-p">And there was the enemy fleet, stretched across the river ahead of them.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mizipi was two thousand feet across at Shappa Ta’atan, and at first glance the ships that faced them seemed to span its entire width.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus knew that the junks of the Jin that the Mongols had commandeered were two-masted and close to a hundred feet long, but he somehow had expected them to be delicate, perhaps paper-thin like the Jin and Song fans he had seen for sale long ago in markets along the Silk Road. The junks had, after all, been portaged across fifty miles of dry land. Instead he saw substantial wooden vessels, not open-hulled like Viking longships but with raised covered decks fore and aft. Their sails were tall, square, and flat; they looked to be strengthened with bamboo slats and hung from sturdy masts. Each junk was crammed with Mongol warriors.</p>
<p class="para-p">Similarly, Marcellinus had known that the oceangoing canoes of the northwestern tribes were larger than the birch-bark canoes of the Cahokians and Haudenosaunee, but he had not expected them to be seventy feet long and as stout-sided as any Norse longship, though nowhere near as broad in the beam. As yet he was too far distant to see details, but their hulls seemed to be brightly painted with sharp, blocky images and martial patterns.</p>
<p class="para-p">Finally, he had not anticipated the swarm of regular Mizipian canoes. “Futete.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Staring forward with eyes wide, Enopay rather automatically said, “Just because you are surrounded by Romans does not mean you should swear like one.” He added: “Do not ask me to count the ships. They weave around too fast.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page200" title="200"/>
<p class="para-p">Trumpets sounded, the flutes at the stern of each quinquereme shrilled, and the pace of the drumbeats quickened as Roma settled in for the charge. Across the quarter-mile divide that separated them from the enemy they could hear the Mongols’ war drums, the giant naccara drums as big as a man. On the junks the din they made must have been thunderous.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Fuck,” Hanska said in reverence.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Chitimachan’s head turned left and right as if she were looking for a hole to hide in. Taianita glanced at Marcellinus and then looked away quickly. Marcellinus tried to iron out the worried frown on his face and tightened his grip on his gladius.</p>
<p class="para-p">In the past his battle fever would have been mounting at such a moment, excitement preparing him for the fight to come. But today all he felt was a nagging concern, a regret for opportunities missed, words left unsaid to people he loved and cared for. He took a deep breath and tried to marshal his thoughts.</p>
<p class="para-p">At the same moment there came a single short blast from a cornu and the bellowed voice of the lookout. “Bombs!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s first instinct was to look down into the water. Had the Mongols laid mines? Could their black powder somehow be impervious to water; could they guess a fuse length with such accuracy? But no, the bombs were flying through the air, seeming to hang lazily in the skies as they reached the peaks of their long arcs.</p>
<p class="para-p">Another call from the lookout. “Trebuchets!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had been so intent on staring at the enemy fleet that he had failed to notice the activity on the Mizipi’s banks. The Jin trebuchets the Mongols were using were not powered by twisted rope and sinew like the Roman onagers Marcellinus had built for Cahokia. Instead, they were powered by men and ropes. To launch a missile, a team of warriors pulled horizontally with a titanic coordinated jerking motion, and their effort was translated by a pulley and multiplied by the lever action of a long throwing arm set on a high frame. The throwing arm acted as a sling, whipping around to fling its projectiles out over the river.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page201" title="201"/>
<p class="para-p">The legs of the trebuchets were sunk into the ground for stability, and from the large branches and other remains of fallen trees that lay around them it was clear that they had been built in place.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">We could improve on those,</em> Marcellinus thought. <em class="char-i">A counterweight would work much more effectively, and besides, they’ll miss us by several boat lengths.</em> Then the first bomb hit the water ahead of them and exploded into a smoky, blinding fog.</p>
<p class="para-p">The trebuchets were not throwing balls of stone or steel, but gas bombs with fuses of hemp.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Lime!” came the cry from the legionaries up and down the quinquereme, and men covered their eyes and noses with their cloaks; others knelt and bowed their heads to limit the amount they breathed. Marcellinus and the others emulated them. At the same time they heard a slamming from beneath them as the louvers were closed to limit the amount of noxious gas getting through to the oarsmen.</p>
<p class="para-p">Fortunately, the trebuchets on the land were having trouble getting the Roman ships’ range. The helmsman changed course to give the first clouds a wide berth, but then more bombs came. One or two fizzled without releasing their gas, but most ignited to spread their contents across the water’s surface. The freshening breeze was from the northwest and blew the clouds of gas right over the central section of the Roman fleet.</p>
<p class="para-p">As the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> rowed through the cloud, the coughing and choking started as the lime smoke irritated the men’s throats. Despite the cloak Marcellinus held in front of his face, the lime gas made his eyes burn.</p>
<p class="para-p">Only those on deck were affected. The flutes had fallen silent now, but the hortatory calls could be heard loud and clear, the drums still beat, and the oarsmen rowed steadily. Eventually Marcellinus stood and looked around him. Eyes were streaming, men were still coughing uncontrollably, and a few of the unluckiest even had blisters forming on their faces and arms where the gas had been densest, but the trebuchets were now behind them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Ahead, most Mongol battle junks were striking their sails and turning to their oars. In battle they would have no time for the intricacies of steering under sail. The center of the Mongol formation bulged as the enemy fleet formed a triangular shape similar to a Roman cuneus, reaching out to strike. A handful of Tlingit canoes and Maya longboats scurried ahead of them, eager to engage the Roman forces.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page202" title="202"/>
<p class="para-p">Likewise, it was as if the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> and the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> were racing to be first into battle. The <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> was slightly in front, and it seemed that the flagship would plow into the enemy ships first, but then the two onagers on its main deck released their loads. Giant boulders flew, and the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> rocked and yawed in reaction. The <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> leaped ahead.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska was shaking her head. “Fucking Shappa Ta’atani. Fuck.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus glanced at Taianita.</p>
<p class="para-p">“<em class="char-i">I</em> am not Shappan,” Taianita spit in a low tone. “I am <em class="char-i">not</em> Shappan.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The birch-bark canoes of the Shappa Ta’atani now vied with those of the Tlingit and Maya, surging out ahead of the battle junks in their determination to meet the enemy. It was clear to them all that the Shappa Ta’atani had changed sides once again and allied with the Mongols. “They already betrayed their own Mizipian people to fight with the Romans against Ocatan,” he said. “What else would you expect of Son of the Sun?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Taianita scowled. “Really? You ask <em class="char-i">me</em> that?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus grinned tightly. “They think they’ve chosen the winning side. Time to prove them wrong.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Roman fleet was approaching the blockade at alarming speed. The junks that had appeared to form a solid line across the Great River had resolved into a swarm of individual ships. There must be more than thirty junks, after all—Marcellinus thought perhaps three dozen—but if the Roman vessels could smash through them and keep going, perhaps the Sixth could carry the day without losing too many more men…</p>
<p class="para-p">Roman horns sounded again, and the two warships at the front of the Roman column separated. The two dragon ships immediately in their wake followed suit. “Ah.” Marcellinus nodded.</p>
<p class="para-p">“What?” said Taianita. “Why do they—”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page203" title="203"/>
<p class="para-p">“Carving a path. The galleys will punch through the Mongol line, and then any Mongol big canoes caught in between them will be trapped between the Roman lines.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“The Mongol ships are lighter.” Enopay frowned, his forehead lined far beyond his years. “The quinqueremes are…clubs. Blunt clubs. They can break through the line, trap the junks in between, which can then be destroyed by the other Roman vessels that come behind. That is what Verus wants. It may not be so easy.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus felt a perverse need to defend his Roman commanding officer. “Not easy but a good strategy nonetheless. And we will enfilade as we go.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska hefted her club. “I hope it is not <em class="char-i">too</em> easy.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Never fear, Hanska. We will find you Mongols to kill.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska nodded, her eyes bleak. For a moment her expression was as fixed as it had been during the dark days along the Kicka River. Enopay glanced up in concern and leaned against her. Absently, Hanska touched Enopay’s shoulder with the hand that was not holding her club.</p>
<p class="para-p">No cheers came from below now. The oarsmen were too busy putting their backs into their rowing. On the upper deck the centurions brought their men to order. The artillerymen at the bulwarks were checking their scorpios, cranking the crossbows back, putting bolts in place. In the longships and knarrs the crews took up their bows and spears. The gunwales of their boats were close to water level, making them prime targets for the Tlingit and Shappan canoes.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Stay close to me,” Marcellinus said to Enopay. “Unless I’m in a melee. Then stay away.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay gave him a quick glance. His expression spoke volumes.</p>
<p class="para-p">As the enemy fleets came within range, the swell of noise was immediate, the din of the scorpios firing their bolts into the sails, men, and hulls of the Mongol battle junks. No Mongol arrows yet reached the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>, but they would soon enough.</p>
<p class="para-p">The <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> and the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> thundered into the Mongol line. Each had aimed to ram a Mongol junk, and the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> hit hers fair and square. Her beaklike ramming prow caught the junk astern and crunched through its hull. Even as the junk’s poop deck rose and splintered, the Mongol warriors aboard it were loosing their arrows to rake the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>’s decks.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page204" title="204"/>
<p class="para-p">The junk the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> had aimed for managed to skim past its lethal ram at the last second. It swung wide to avoid getting tangled in the oars of the quinquereme, and then its striking arm crashed down. This was a hinged pole fifty feet long tipped with a heavy slab of iron the shape of a hammerhead, similar to the Roman corvus but much longer. The corvus was essentially a broad gangplank designed to slam into an enemy ship’s deck and hold it close enough for legionaries to board across it, but Marcellinus could see that the Mongol striking arms had a different function: their goal was to hold the ships apart, keep the enemy at a distance so that they could be bombarded. In light of their advantage with the black powder bombs and their excellent bowmanship, the Mongols favored bombardment over boarding; that matched their tactics on land of not engaging in hand-to-hand fighting unless forced to.</p>
<p class="para-p">The striking arm of a second Mongol junk thumped into the deck of the <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> on its starboard side. A moment later came the boom of an explosion as a thunder crash bomb ignited. The <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> swayed ponderously from the impact. A cloud of black smoke drifted upward, and an acrid smell tinged the air.</p>
<p class="para-p">As the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em> and <em class="char-i">Triumphus</em> slowed as a result of their impacts, the two dragon ships steered into the gap between them. The drekar to starboard rammed a Mongol junk and came to an almost immediate halt in the river, its stern rising clear of the water. With a roar, Roman soldiers stepped up onto the longship’s gunwale and leaped onto the foredeck of the junk. Mongols hurried to defend against them, and steel rang against steel. As for the left drekar, two Tlingit canoes barely any shorter were pulling alongside, arrows flying, and behind them several eight-man canoes of the Shappa Ta’atani.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enemy ships swarmed the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> now, junks coming in from each side at an angle, Tlingit canoes passing behind, ready to assault them from the stern. Aboard the nearest junk Marcellinus saw the spark of fire. A slow flame smoldered, ready to ignite a thunder crash bomb. “Shoot that man!” Marcellinus shouted. The nearest legionary artilleryman saw the threat and swung his scorpio around, his bolt already loaded and ready.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page205" title="205"/>
<p class="para-p">The Jin warrior died with a scream, impaled against the hull of his boat, and his thunder crash bomb rolled away into the scuppers of the battle junk. Its fuse sparked and hissed. “Down!” Marcellinus shouted, but the next moment the bomb went off, strafing the crews of both ships with hot metal and ceramic shards. The battle junk took the worst of it, and water immediately gushed in through its hull.</p>
<p class="para-p">Alongside the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>, the <em class="char-i">Fides</em> arrowed away at a diagonal. Its way was blocked by four junks. Trying to plow through them would be suicide, and her ship’s master was aiming to breach the line where it was weaker. Unfortunately, three of the four junks the <em class="char-i">Fides</em> had avoided now changed course to converge on the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had a brief mental image of a horse being taken down and mauled to death by a pack of dogs. He stepped up beside his ship’s master. “We can’t let them divide us like this. We must get alongside Verus in the <em class="char-i">Fortuna</em>. Fight one battle, not many. Can we—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Fuck off,” Titus Otho said tersely. “I’m busy.”</p>
<p class="para-p">It was too late anyway. The dragon ships ahead of them had been boarded, their crews in a melee with the almost naked but ferocious warriors of the Tlingit and Shappa Ta’atani. The <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> could not thread the needle between the two drekars, and if they changed course too dramatically, they risked being rammed by their own ships coming up from behind, as the <em class="char-i">Minerva</em> and the <em class="char-i">Clementia</em> had split to flank the battle.</p>
<p class="para-p">Besides, the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> had its own problems. In all, six battle junks were converging on Marcellinus’s quinquereme. A bolt from the <em class="char-i">Minerva</em>’s ballista slammed into the hull of the leading junk just below where the Mongol helmsman stood, splintering the wood. To the helmsman’s credit, the wake of his junk barely wavered. In a few moments they would be within striking-arm range.</p>
<p class="para-p">The master of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> was indeed busy shouting orders to his own helmsman. Vibius Caecina, tribune of the Eighth and Ninth Cohorts, was standing amidships directing the ballistarii, the catapult crew.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page206" title="206"/>
<p class="para-p">This was hardly Marcellinus’s theater of war, but he could not help himself. He strode forward along the port line of artillerymen at their scorpios. “Target any Mongol readying a bomb, target anyone with a flame or a fuse, and after them the helmsmen—”</p>
<p class="para-p">The <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> rocked as two Mongol striking arms came down simultaneously into its starboard deck, one close to the prow and one barely thirty feet from where Marcellinus stood.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Cut it! Guard them!”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Roman marines around him acted instantly, some leaping forward with axes to try to cut the nearer striking arm away while others provided covering fire with scorpio bolts, arrows, and spears, or sheltered their axmen behind tall shields.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Thunder crash!” Enopay shouted, and hit the deck.</p>
<p class="para-p">It came arcing through the air from the first of the junks to port. The bomb exploded well above the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>, its fuse too short, but again came that unearthly crackling explosion of black powder. Shards of hot metal strafed the legionaries in front of Marcellinus. The blast threw many men through the air to slam into the decks, broken and still.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Shit, shit…” Marcellinus spun and checked his people. Enopay was uninjured, but Hanska was staring with vicious hatred at a deep laceration in her right forearm. “Hanska?”</p>
<p class="para-p">She raised her gaze and stared at the Mongol junk just a few dozen feet away across the water with a baleful expression. She wasn’t seriously hurt.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Romans had hacked away the tip of the rearmost striking arm. The harpax fired with an astonishingly loud twang, followed by the sound of scraping cable. The harpoon buried itself in the hull of the battle junk just below its poop deck. Men hauled. The Mongols on the junk dropped their oars, grabbed weapons, and swarmed the deck, ready for combat.</p>
<p class="para-p">At Titus Otho’s shouted command the helmsman put the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> hard to starboard. It swung toward the closest junk. From behind, the <em class="char-i">Minerva</em> came around them to tackle the line of junks on the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>’s port side.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page207" title="207"/>
<p class="para-p">The battle junk crunched up against the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>. “Let them come to us! Get ready! Formation! Prepare to be boarded!” Marcellinus shouted.</p>
<p class="para-p">The quinqueremes’ upper decks were a dozen feet above the waterline, the junks’ only slightly less. The two bands of warriors met on almost equal terms. The Romans braced, and the Mongols poured aboard.</p>
<p class="para-p">With a bloodcurdling scream of rage Hanska was off and running, straight into the midst of the Mongols, her ax held high.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Enopay, back, hide.” Marcellinus scanned the deck briefly: two junks to starboard disgorging Mongol warriors, another two at striking-arm length, with a shooting war going on between Romans behind shields and Mongols behind the bulwark of their ship. Three more farther away, being rowed in curved paths, looking for an opening. The legionaries on the fighting towers alternately strafing the Mongols on the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>’s deck and holding off the other battle junks. A dedicated couple of centuries guarded the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>’s single onager, which was still firing regularly over their heads at the junks attempting to close with the <em class="char-i">Fides</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">From behind Marcellinus came two almost simultaneous explosions. One was from close by, and the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em> juddered hard, and the second explosion came from farther away, setting fire to the fighting tower on the <em class="char-i">Minerva</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was trained for command but had no troops at his disposal. For the moment he was just a soldier, and he could delay no longer. He realized that Enopay was still by his side. “Juno, Enopay! Find Romans and hide behind them!” Drawing his gladius, he sprinted toward the nearest fray, where Mongols and Romans were fighting for control of the rear starboard bulwark of the <em class="char-i">Providentia</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">As he saw his first Mongol faces close up in this battle, Marcellinus’s anger finally took hold of him. The massacre of the unarmed Romans and People of the Hand at Yupkoyvi, the brutality of the forced march across the desert, the Khan’s murder of Mikasi and enslavement of Pezi: his fury at all of this suddenly erupted and propelled him. His gladius sank into a Mongol arm until it crunched on the bone. He snatched it back and swung at an unprotected neck, kicked a warrior overboard. Parried as a warrior with Jin features stabbed low at his already injured calf and slashed the man viciously across his stomach. Blood not his own splashed across Marcellinus’s chest and arm, and he pushed forward to reach Hanska’s side.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page208" title="208"/>
<p class="para-p">Hanska fought like a woman possessed, shoving her way into the mass of Mongol sailors to stab and slay. She screamed as she did so, the raw sound visibly terrifying the men around her. Marcellinus stayed well to her left—in her berserker rage she might not recognize him until after she had disemboweled him—and ensured that no Mongol could flank her.</p>
<p class="para-p">On his other side Roman legionaries fought with him shoulder to shoulder. Mongols had the advantage at distance fighting, but in hand-to-hand combat Romans had the edge. In equal numbers, the Romans’ discipline and better steel would prevail.</p>
<p class="para-p">Whether their numbers were truly equal, Marcellinus could not tell. Fighting was taking place in concentrated knots all across the deck of the warship. Behind and around him came the occasional flare and explosion of black powder, and sometimes the deck shifted beneath his feet, but he fought on: hacking, slashing, slaying.</p></div></body></html>

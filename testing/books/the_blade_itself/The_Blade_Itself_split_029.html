<div id="filepos766788" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Better than Death</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We’re looking for a woman,” said the officer, staring at them suspiciously. “An escaped slave, a killer. Very dangerous.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A woman, master?” asked Yulwei, his brow wrinkled with confusion. “Dangerous, master?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, a woman!” The officer waved his hand impatiently. “Tall, with a scar, hair cropped short. Well-armed, most likely, with a bow.” Ferro stood there, tall and scarred, hair cropped short, bow over her shoulder, and looked down at the dusty ground. “She is wanted, by the highest of authorities! A thief and a murderer, many times over!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei gave a humble smile and spread his hands. “We have seen no such person master. I and my son are unarmed, as you can see.” Ferro looked down uncomfortably at the curved blade of the sword stuck through her belt, shining in the bright sun. The officer didn’t seem to notice though. He swatted at a fly as Yulwei blathered on. “Neither one of us would know what to do with such a thing as a bow, I can assure you. We trust in God to protect us, master, and in the Emperor’s matchless soldiers.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The officer snorted. “Very wise, old man. What’s your business here?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I am a merchant, on my way to Dagoska, to purchase spices,” and he gave a grovelling bow, “with your kind permission.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Trading with the pinks are you? Damn Union!” The officer spat in the dust. “Still, a man has to make a living, I suppose, if a shameful one. Trade while you can, the pinks will be gone soon, swept back into the ocean!” He puffed out his chest with pride. “The Emperor, Uthman-ul-Dosht, has sworn it! What do you think of that, old man?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, it will be a great day, a great day,” said Yulwei, bowing low again, “may God bring it to us soon, master!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The officer looked Ferro up and down. “Your son looks a strong lad. Perhaps he’d make a soldier.” He took a step towards her and grabbed hold of her bare arm. “That’s a strong arm. That arm could draw a bow, I’d say, if it were taught. What do you say, boy? A man’s work, fighting for the glory of God, and your Emperor! Better than grubbing for a pittance!” Ferro’s flesh crawled where his fingers touched her skin. Her other hand crept towards her knife.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Alas,” said Yulwei quickly, “my son was born… simple. He scarcely speaks.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah. A shame. The time may come when we need every man. Savages they may be, but these pinks can fight.” The officer turned away and Ferro scowled after him. “Very well, you may go!” He waved them on. The eyes of his soldiers, lounging in the shade of the palms around the road, followed them as they walked past, but without much interest.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro held her tongue until the encampment had dwindled into the distance behind them, then she rounded on Yulwei. “Dagoska?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“To begin with,” said the old man, staring off across the scrubby plain. “And then north.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“North?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Across the Circle Sea to Adua.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Across the sea? She stopped in the road. “I’m not fucking going there!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Must you make everything so difficult, Ferro? Are you that happy here in Gurkhul?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“These northerners are mad, everyone knows it! Pinks, Union, or whatever. Mad! Godless!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei raised an eyebrow at her. “I didn’t know you were so interested in God, Ferro.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“At least I know there is one!” she shouted, pointing at the sky. “These pinks, they don’t think like us, like real people! We’ve no business with their kind! I’d rather stay among the Gurkish! Besides, I’ve scores to settle here.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What scores? Going to kill Uthman?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She frowned. “Perhaps I will.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh.” Yulwei turned and headed off up the road. “They’re looking for you, Ferro, in case you hadn’t noticed. You wouldn’t get ten strides without my help. They’ve still got that cage waiting, remember? The one in front of the palace? They are anxious to fill it.” Ferro ground her teeth. “Uthman is the Emperor now. Ul-Dosht, they call him. The mighty! The merciless! Greatest Emperor for a hundred years, they are saying already. Kill the Emperor!” Yulwei chuckled to himself. “You’re quite a character alright. Quite a character.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro scowled as she followed the old man up the hill. She wasn’t looking to be anyone’s character. Yulwei could make these soldiers see whatever he pleased, and that was a smart trick, but she’d be damned if she was going north. What business did she have with those godless pinks?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei was still chuckling away as she drew level with him. “Kill the Emperor.” He shook his head. “He’ll just have to wait until you get back. You owe me, remember?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro grabbed him by the sinewy arm. “I don’t remember you saying anything about crossing the sea!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I don’t remember your asking, Maljinn, and you should be glad you didn’t!” He peeled her fingers gently away. “Your corpse might be drying nicely in the desert, instead of grumbling in my ear, all sleek and healthy—think on that a while.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">That shut her up for the time being. She walked along in silence, scowling out across the scrubby landscape, sandals crunching on the dry dirt of the road. She looked sidelong at the old man. He’d saved her life with his tricks, that couldn’t be denied.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But she’d be damned if she was going north.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The fortress was concealed in a rocky cove, but from where they were, high up on the bluff with the fierce sun behind them, Ferro could see the shape of it well enough. A high wall enclosed neat rows of buildings, enough to make a small town. Next to the them, built out into the water, were long wharves. Moored to the wharves were ships.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Huge ships.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Towers of wood, floating fortresses. Ferro had never seen ships half that size. Their masts were a dark forest against the bright water behind. Ten were docked below them, and further out in the bay two more were cutting slowly through the waves, great sails billowing, tiny figures crawling on the decks and in amongst the spider’s web of ropes above.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I see twelve,” murmured Yulwei, “but your eyes are the sharper.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro looked out across the water. Further round the curving shore, twenty miles away perhaps, she could see another fortress, another set of wharves. “There are more over there,” she said, “eight or nine, and those ones are bigger.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bigger than these?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A lot bigger.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“God’s breath!” muttered Yulwei to himself. “The Gurkish never built ships so big before, not half so big, nor half so many. There is not the wood in all the South for such a fleet. They must have bought it from the north, from the Styrians, maybe.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro cared nothing for boats, or wood, or the north. “So?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“With a fleet this size, the Gurkish will be a power at sea. They could take Dagoska from the bay, invade Westport even.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The pointless names of far-away places. “So?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You don’t understand, Ferro. I must warn the others. We must make haste, now!” He pushed himself up from the ground and hurried back towards the road.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro grunted. She watched the big wooden tubs moving back and forth in the bay for a moment longer, then she got up and followed Yulwei. Great ships or tiny ships, it meant nothing to her. The Gurkish could take all the pinks in the world for slaves as far as she was concerned.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">If that meant they left the real people alone.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Out of the way!” The soldier spurred his horse right at them, raising his whip.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A thousand pardons, master!” whined Yulwei, grovelling to the ground, scuttling off into the grass beside the road, pulling Ferro reluctantly by the elbow. She stood in the scrub, watching the column shamble slowly by. Thin figures, ragged, dirty, vacant, hands bound tightly, hollow eyes on the ground. Men and women, all ages, children even. A hundred or more. Six guards rode alongside them, easy in their tall saddles, whips rolled up in their hands.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Slaves.” Ferro licked her dry lips.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The people of Kadir have risen up,” said Yulwei, frowning at the miserable procession. “They wished no longer to be part of the glorious nation of Gurkhul, and thought the death of the Emperor might be their chance to leave. It seems they were wrong. The new Emperor is harder even than the last, eh, Ferro? Their rebellion has failed already. It seems your friend Uthman has taken slaves as punishment.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro watched a scrawny girl limping slowly, bare feet trailing in the dust. Thirteen years old? It was hard to tell. Her face was dirty and listless. There was a scabby cut across her forehead, others on the back of her arm. Whip marks. Ferro swallowed, watched the girl toiling along. An old man, just in front of her, tripped and sprawled face first into the road, making the whole column stumble to a halt.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Move!” barked one of the riders, spurring his horse forward. “On your feet!” The old man struggled in the dust. “Move!” The soldier’s whip cracked, leaving a long red mark across the man’s scrawny back. Ferro twitched and winced at the sound, and her back began to tingle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Where the scars were.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Almost as if she’d been whipped herself.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">No one whips Ferro Maljinn and lives. Not any more. She shrugged the bow off her shoulder.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Peace, Ferro!” hissed Yulwei, grabbing her by the arm. “There’s nothing you can do for them!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The girl bent down, helping the old slave to his feet. The whip cracked again, catching them both, and there was a yelp of pain. Was it the girl or the man who had cried out?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Or had it been Ferro herself?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She shook Yulwei’s hand off, reaching for an arrow. “I can kill this bastard!” she snarled. The soldier’s head snapped round to look at them, curious. Yulwei seized hold of her hand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What then?” he hissed. “If you killed all six of them, what then? Have you food and water for a hundred slaves? Eh? You have it well concealed! And when the column is missed? Eh? And their guards found slaughtered? What then, killer? Will you hide a hundred slaves out here? Because I cannot!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro stared into Yulwei’s black eyes, her teeth grinding together, her breath snorting fast through her nose. She wondered whether or not to try and kill him again.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">No.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was right, damn him. Slowly, she pushed the anger back, as far down as it would go. She shoved the arrow away, and turned back towards the column. She watched the old slave stumble on, and the girl after him, fury gnawing at her guts like hunger.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You!” called the soldier, nudging his horse over towards them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’ve done it now!” hissed Yulwei, then he bowed to the guard, smiling, scraping. “My apologies master, my son is…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shut your mouth, old man!” The soldier looked down at Ferro from his saddle. “Well, boy, do you like her?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What?” she hissed, through gritted teeth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No need to be shy,” chuckled the soldier, “I’ve seen you looking.” He turned towards the column. “Hold them up there!” he shouted, and the slaves stumbled to a halt. He leaned from his saddle and grabbed the scrawny girl under the armpit, dragging her roughly out of the column.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“She’s a good one,” he said, pulling her towards Ferro. “Bit young, but she’s ready. Clean up nice, she will. Bit of a limp but that’ll heal, we’ve been driving ’em hard. Good teeth… show him your teeth, bitch!” The girl’s cracked lips curled back slowly. “Good teeth. What do you say boy? Ten in gold for her! It’s a good price!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro stood there, staring. The girl looked dumbly back with big, dead eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Look,” said the soldier, leaning down from his saddle. “She’s worth twice that, and there’s no danger in it! When we get to Shaffa, I’ll tell them she died out here in the dust. No one will wonder at that, it happens all the time! I get ten, and you save ten! Everyone wins!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Everyone wins. Ferro stared up at the guard. He pulled his helmet off, wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. “Peace, Ferro,” whispered Yulwei.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Alright, eight!” Shouted the soldier. “She’s got a nice smile! Show him a smile, bitch!” The corner of the girl’s mouth twitched slightly. “There, see! Eight, and you’re stealing from me!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro’s fists were clenched, nails digging into her palms. “Peace, Ferro,” whispered Yulwei, with a warning note in his voice.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“God’s teeth but you drive a bargain boy! Seven, and that’s my last offer. Seven, damn it!” The soldier waved his helmet around in frustration. “Use her gently, in five years she’ll be worth more! It’s an investment!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The soldier’s face was just a few feet away. She could see each tiny bead of sweat forming on his forehead, each stubbly hair on his cheeks, each blemish, nick, and pore on his skin. She could smell him, almost.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The truly thirsty will drink piss, or salt water, or oil, however bad for them, so great is their need to drink. Ferro had seen it often in the badlands. That was the extent of her need to kill this man now. She wanted to tear him with her bare hands, to choke the life from him, to rip his face with her teeth. The desire was almost too strong to resist. “Peace!” hissed Yulwei.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I can’t afford her,” Ferro heard herself saying.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You might have said so before, boy, and saved me the trouble!” The soldier stuck his helmet back on. “Still, I can’t blame you for looking. She’s a good one.” He reached down and grabbed the girl under the arm, dragging her back towards the others. “They’ll get twenty for her in Shaffa!” he shouted over his shoulder. The column moved on. Ferro watched the girl until the slaves disappeared over a rise, stumbling, limping, shambling towards slavery.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She felt cold now, cold and empty. She wished she had killed the guard, whatever the cost. Killing him could have filled that empty space, if only for a while. That was how it worked. “I walked in a column like that,” she said slowly.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei gave a long sigh. “I know, Ferro, I know, but fate has chosen you for saving. Be grateful for it, if you know how.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You should have let me kill him.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Eugh,” clucked the old man in disgust, “I do declare, you’d kill the whole world if you could. Is there anything but killing in you Ferro?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There used to be,” she muttered, “but they whip it out of you. They whip you until they’re sure there’s nothing left.” Yulwei stood there, with that pitying look on his face. Strange, how it didn’t make her angry any more.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m sorry, Ferro. Sorry for you and for them.” He stepped back into the road, shaking his head. “But it’s better than death.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She stayed for a moment, watching the dust rising from the distant column.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The same,” she whispered to herself.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_29"></div></div></body>

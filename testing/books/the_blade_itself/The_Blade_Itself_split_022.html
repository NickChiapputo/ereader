<div id="filepos584170" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> What Freedom Looks Like</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The point of the shovel bit into the ground with the sharp scrape of metal on earth. An all too familiar sound. It didn’t bite in far, for all the effort put behind it, as the soil was rocky hard and baked by the sun.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But she wasn’t to be deterred by a little hard soil.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She had dug too many holes, and in ground worse for digging than this.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">When the fighting is over, you dig, if you’re still alive. You dig graves for your dead comrades. A last mark of respect, however little you might have had for them. You dig as deep as you can be bothered, you dump them in, you cover them up, they rot away and are forgotten. That’s the way it’s always been.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She flicked her shoulder and a sent a shovelful of sandy soil flying. Her eyes followed the grains of dirt and little stones as they broke apart in the air, then fell across the face of one of the soldiers. One eye stared at her reproachfully. The other had one of her arrows snapped off in it. A couple of flies were buzzing lazily around his face. There would be no burial for him, the graves were for her people. He and his bastard friends could lie out in the merciless sun.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">After all, the vultures have to eat.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The blade of the shovel swished through the air and bit again into the soil. Another clump of dirt tumbled away. She straightened up and wiped the sweat from her face. She squinted up at the sky. The sun was blazing, straight above, sucking whatever moisture remained out of the dusty landscape, drying the blood on the rocks. She looked at the two graves beside her. One more to go. She would finish this one, throw the earth on top of those three fools, rest for a moment, then away.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Others would be coming for her soon enough.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She stuck the shovel into the earth, took hold of the water skin and pulled the stopper out. She took a few lukewarm swallows, even allowed herself the luxury of pouring a trickle out into her grimy hand and splashing it on her face. The early deaths of her comrades had at least put a stop to the endless squabbling over water.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There would be plenty to go round now.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Water…” gasped the soldier by the rocks. It was surprising, but he was still alive. Her arrow had missed his heart but it had killed him still—just a little less quickly than she had intended. He had managed to drag himself as far as the rocks, but his crawling days were over. The stones around him were coated in dark blood. The heat and that arrow would do for him soon, however tough he was.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She wasn’t thirsty, but there was water to spare and she wouldn’t be able to carry it all. She took a few more swallows, letting it slosh out of her mouth and down her neck. A rare treat out here in the Badlands, to let water fall. Shining drops spattered onto the dry earth, turning it dark. She splashed some more on her face, licked her lips, and looked over at the soldier.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Mercy…” he croaked, one hand clasped to his chest where the arrow was sticking out of it, the other stretched weakly towards her.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Mercy? Hah!” She pushed the stopper back into the skin, then tossed it down next to the grave. “Don’t you know who I am?” She grabbed hold of the handle of the shovel, the point of its blade bit once more into the earth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ferro Maljinn!” came a voice from somewhere behind her, “I know who you are!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A most unwelcome development.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She swung the shovel again, mind racing. Her bow was lying just out of reach on the ground by the first grave she had dug. She threw some dirt away, her sweating shoulders prickling at the unseen presence. She glanced over at the dying soldier. He was staring at a point behind her, and that gave her a good idea where this new arrival was standing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She dug the point of the shovel in again, then let go and sprang forward out of the hole, rolling across the dirt, snatching up her bow as she moved, notching an arrow, drawing back the string in one smooth motion. An old man was standing about ten strides away. He was making no move forward, was holding no weapon. He was just standing, looking at her with a benign smile.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She let the arrow fly.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Now Ferro was about as deadly with a bow as it’s possible to be. The ten dead soldiers could have testified to that, if they’d been able. Six of them had her arrows sticking out of them, and in that fight she hadn’t missed once. She couldn’t remember missing at close range, however quickly the shot had been taken, and she’d killed men ten times further away than this smiling old bastard was now.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But this time she missed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The arrow seemed to curve in the air. A bad feather maybe, but it still didn’t seem quite right. The old man didn’t flinch, not even a hair. He simply stood, smiling, exactly where he’d always stood, and the arrow missed him by a few inches and disappeared off down the hillside.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">And that gave everyone time to consider the situation.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was a strange one, this old man. Very dark-skinned, black as coal, which meant he was from the far south, across the wide and shelterless desert. That’s a journey not lightly taken, and Ferro had rarely seen such people. Tall and thin with long, sinewy arms and a simple robe wrapped round him. There were strange bangles round his wrists, stacked up so they covered half his forearms, glittering dark and light in the savage sun.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">His hair was a mass of grey ropes about his face, some hanging down as low as his waist, and there was a grey stubble on his lean, pointed jaw. He had a big water skin wrapped around his chest, and a bunch of leather bags hanging from a belt around his waist. Nothing else. No weapon. That was the strangest thing of all, for a man out here in the Badlands. No one came to this god-forsaken place except those who were running, and those sent to hunt them. In either case, they should be well armed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was no soldier of Gurkhul, he was no scum come looking for the money on her head. He was no bandit, no escaped slave. What was he then? And why was he here? He must have come for her. He could be one of them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">An Eater.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Who else would wander the Badlands without a weapon? She hadn’t realised they wanted her that badly.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He stood there motionless, the old man, smiling at her. She reached slowly for another arrow, and his eyes followed her without any worry.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That really isn’t necessary,” he said, in a slow, deep voice.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She nocked the arrow to her bow. The old man didn’t move. She shrugged her shoulders and took her time aiming. The old man smiled on, not a care in the world. She let the arrow fly. It missed him by a few inches again, this time on the other side, and shot off down the hillside.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Once was a possibility, she had to admit that, but twice was wrong. If Ferro knew one thing, and one thing only, she knew how to kill. The old fool should have been stuck through and bleeding out his last into the stony soil. Now, simply by standing still and smiling, he seemed to be saying, “You know less than you think. I know more.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">That was very galling.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who are you, you old bastard?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They call me Yulwei.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Old bastard will do for you!” She tossed her bow down on the ground, let her arms drop to her sides so that her right hand was hidden from him by her body. She twisted her wrist and the curved knife dropped out of her sleeve and into her waiting palm. There are many ways to kill a man, and if one way fails you must try another.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro had never been one to give up at the first stumble.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei began to move slowly towards her, his bare feet padding on the rocks, bangles jingling softly together. That was very strange, now she thought about it. If he made a noise every time he moved, how had he managed to sneak up on her?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What do you want?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I want to help you.” He came forward, until he was just over an arm’s length away, then he stopped and stood, grinning at her.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Now Ferro was fast as a snake with a knife and twice as deadly, as the last of those soldiers could have testified, had he been able. The blade was a shining blur in the air, swung with all her strength and all her fury behind it. If he had been standing where she thought he was, his head would have been hanging off. Only he wasn’t. He was standing about a stride to the left.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She threw herself at him with a fighting scream, ramming the glittering point of the knife into his heart. But she stabbed only air. He was back where he had been before, motionless and smiling all the while. Very strange. She padded round him, cautious, sandaled feet scuffing in the dust, left hand circling in the air in front of her, right hand gripped tight round the handle of the knife. She had to be careful—there was magic here.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There is no need to get angry. I am here to help.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Fuck your help,” she hissed back at him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But you need it, and badly. They are coming for you, Ferro. There are soldiers in the hills, many soldiers.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’ll outrun them.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There are too many. You cannot outrun them all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She glanced round at the punctured bodies. “Then I’ll give them to the vultures.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not this time. They are not alone. They have help.” On the word “help” his deep voice dropped even lower.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro frowned. “Priests?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, and more besides.” His eyes went very wide. “An Eater,” he whispered. “They mean to take you alive. The Emperor wants to make an example of you. He has it in mind to put you on display.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She snorted. “Fuck the Emperor.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I heard you already did.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She growled and raised the knife again, but it was not a knife. There was a hissing snake in her hand, a deadly snake, with its mouth open to bite. “Ugh!” She threw it on the ground, stamped her foot down on its head, but she stamped on her knife instead. The blade snapped with a sharp crack.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They will catch you,” said the old man. “They will catch you, and they will break your legs with hammers in the city square, so you can never run again. Then they will parade you through the streets of Shaffa, naked, sitting backwards on an ass, with your hair shaved off, while the people line the streets and shout insults at you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She frowned at him, but Yulwei did not stop. “They will starve you to death in a cage before the palace, cooking in the hot sun, while the good people of Gurkhul taunt you and spit on you and throw dung at you through the bars. Perhaps they will give you piss to drink, if you are lucky. When you finally die they will let you rot, and the flies will eat you bit by bit, and all the other slaves will see what freedom looks like, and decide they are better off as they are.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro was bored with this. Let them come, and the Eater too. She wouldn’t die in a cage. She would cut her own throat, if it came to that. She turned her back on him with a scowl and snatched up the shovel, started digging away furiously at the last grave. Soon it was deep enough.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Deep enough for the scum who’d be rotting in it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She turned around. Yulwei was kneeling down by the dying soldier, giving him water from the skin round his chest.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Fuck!” she shouted, striding over, her fingers locked around the handle of the shovel.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man got to his feet as she came close. “Mercy…” croaked the soldier, stretching out his hand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’ll give you mercy!” The edge of the shovel bit deep into the soldier’s skull. The body twitched briefly then was still. She turned to the old man with a look of triumph. He stared back sadly. There was something in his eyes. Pity, maybe.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What do you want, Ferro Maljinn?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Why did you do that?” Yulwei pointed down at the dead man. “What do you want?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Vengeance.” She spat out the word.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“On all of them? On the whole nation of Gurkhul? Every man, woman and child?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“All of them!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man looked round the corpses. “Then you must be very happy with today’s work.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She forced a smile onto her face. “Yes.” But she wasn’t very happy. She couldn’t remember what it felt like. The smile seemed strange, unfamiliar, all lop-sided.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And is vengeance all you think of, every minute of every day, your only desire?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hurting </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">them</span></span><span class="calibre3">? Killing </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">them</span></span><span class="calibre3">? Ending </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">them</span></span><span class="calibre3">?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You want nothing for yourself?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She paused. “What?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“For yourself. What do </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">you</span></span><span class="calibre3"> want?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She stared at the old man suspiciously, but no reply came to her. Yulwei shook his head sadly. “It seems to me, Ferro Maljinn, that you are as much a slave as you ever were. Or ever could be.” He sat down, cross-legged on a rock.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She stared at him for a moment, confused. Then the anger bubbled up again, hot and reassuring. “If you came to help me, you can help me bury them!” She pointed over at the three bloody corpses, lined up next to the graves.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh no. That is your work.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She turned away from the old man, cursing under her breath, and moved over to her one-time companions. She took Shebed’s corpse under the arms and hauled him over to the first grave, his heels making two little grooves in the dust. When she made it to the hole she rolled him in. Alugai was next. A stream of dry soil ran over him as he came to rest in the bottom of his grave.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She turned to Nasar’s carcass. He had been killed by a sword cut across the face. Ferro thought it was something of an improvement to his looks.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That one looks a good sort,” said Yulwei.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Nasar.” She laughed without amusement. “A raper, a thief, a coward.” She hawked up some phlegm and spat into his dead face. It splattered softly against his forehead. “Much the worst of the three.” She looked down at the graves. “But they were all of them shit.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Nice company you keep.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The hunted don’t have the luxury of choosing their companions.” She stared at Nasar’s bloody face. “You take what’s offered.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“If you disliked them so much, why don’t you leave them for the vultures, like you have these others?” Yulwei swept his arm over the broken soldiers on the ground.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You bury your own.” She kicked Nasar into the hole. He rolled forward, arms flopping, and dropped into the grave face down. “That’s the way it’s always been.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She grabbed hold of the shovel and started to heap the stony earth onto his back. She worked in silence, the sweat building up on her face, then dripping off onto the ground. Yulwei watched her as the holes filled up. Three more piles of dirt in the wasteland. She threw the shovel away and it bounced off one of the corpses and clattered among the stones. A small cloud of black flies buzzed angrily off the body, then returned.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro picked up her bow and arrows and slung them over her shoulder. She took the water skin, checked its weight carefully, then shouldered that also. Then she picked over the bodies of the soldiers. One of them, he looked like the leader, had a fine curved sword. He hadn’t even managed to draw it before her arrow had caught him in the throat. Ferro drew it now, and she tested it with a couple of sweeps through the air. It was very good: well balanced, the long blade glittering deadly sharp, bright metal on the hilt catching the sun. He had a knife as well that matched it. She took the weapons and stuck them through her belt.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She picked over the other bodies, but there wasn’t much to take. She cut her arrows from the corpses where she could. She found some coins and tossed them away. They would only weigh her down, and what would she buy out here in the Badlands? Dirt?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">That was all there was, and it was free.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They had a few scraps of food with them, but not enough even for another day. That meant there must be others, probably lots of them, and not far away. Yulwei was telling the truth, but it made no difference to her.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She turned and started to walk southward, down off the hill and towards the great desert, leaving the old man behind.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s the wrong way,” he said.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She stopped, squinting at him in the bright sun. “Aren’t the soldiers coming?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei’s eyes sparkled. “There are many ways of staying unnoticed, even out here in the Badlands.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She looked to the north, out over the featureless plain below. Out towards Gurkhul. There wasn’t a hill, or a tree, or scarcely a bush for miles. Nowhere to hide. “Unnoticed, even by an Eater?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man laughed. “Especially by those arrogant swine. They’re not half as clever as they think they are. How do you think I got here? I came through them, between them, around them. I go where I please, and I take who I please with me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She shaded her eyes with her hand, and squinted southward. The desert stretched away into the far distance, and beyond. Ferro could survive here in the wilderness, just about, but out there in that crucible of changing sands and merciless heat?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man seemed to read her thoughts. “There are always the endless sands. I have crossed them before. It can be done. But not by you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was right, damn him. Ferro was lean and tough as a bowstring, but that just meant she would walk in circles a little longer before pitching on her face. The desert was preferable to the cage before the palace as a place to die, but not by much. She wanted to stay alive.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There were still things to do.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man sat there, cross-legged, smiling. What was he? Ferro trusted no one, but if he meant to deliver her to the Emperor, he could have knocked her on the head while she was digging, instead of announcing his arrival. He had magic, she had seen that for herself, and some chance was better than none.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But what would he want in return? The world had never given Ferro anything for free, and she didn’t expect it to begin now. She narrowed her eyes. “What do you want from me, Yulwei?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The old man laughed. That laugh was becoming very annoying. “Let us just say that I will have done you a favour. Later on, you can do me one in return.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">That answer was horribly thin on the details, but when your life’s on the table you have to take whatever’s offered. She hated to place herself in the power of another, but it seemed she had no choice.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Not if she wanted to live out the week, that is.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What do we do?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We must wait for nightfall.” Yulwei glanced at the twisted bodies scattered about the ground, and wrinkled his nose. “But perhaps not here.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro shrugged and sat herself down on the middle grave. “Here will do,” she said, “I’ve a mind to watch the vultures eat.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Overhead the clear night sky was scattered with bright stars, and the air had turned cool, cold even. Down on the dark and dusty plain below, fires were burning, a curved line of fires that seemed to hem them in against the edge of the desert. She, Yulwei, the ten corpses and the three graves were trapped on the hillside. Tomorrow, as the first light crept over the arid land, the soldiers would leave those fires and creep carefully towards the hills. If Ferro was still there when they arrived, she would be killed for sure, or worse still captured. She could not fight that many on her own, even supposing there was no Eater with them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She hated to admit it, but her life was in Yulweis hands now.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He squinted up at the starry sky. “It is time,” he said.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They scrambled down the rocky hillside in the darkness, picking their way carefully among the boulders and the odd, scrubby, half-dead bush. Northward, towards Gurkhul. Yulwei moved surprisingly fast and she was forced to half-run to keep up, eyes fixed on the ground to find her footing among the dry rocks. When they finally reached the base of the hill and she looked up, she saw that Yulwei was leading her toward the left hand edge of the line, where the fires were most numerous.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Wait,” she whispered, grabbing his shoulder. She pointed over to the right hand side. There were fewer fires there, and it would be easier to slip between them. “What about that way?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She could just see Yulwei’s teeth smiling white in the starlight. “Oh no, Ferro Maljinn. That is where most of the soldiers are… and our other friend.” He was making no attempt to keep his voice down, and it was making her jumpy. “That is where they expect you to come through, if you choose to go north. But they do not expect you. They think you will go south into the desert to die, rather than risk being captured, as indeed you would have done, had I not been here.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei turned and moved off and she crept after him, keeping low to the ground. As they drew nearer to the fires she saw that the old man had been right. There were figures sitting around some of them, but they were thinly spread. The old man strode confidently toward four fires on the far left, only one of them manned. He made no effort to stay low, his bangles jingled softly together, his bare feet flapped loud on the dry earth. They were almost close enough to see the features of the three men round the fire. Yulwei would surely be seen at any moment. She hissed at him to grab his attention, sure that she would be heard.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Yulwei turned round, looking puzzled in the faint light from the flames. “What?” he said. She winced, waiting for the soldiers to leap up, but they chattered on regardless. Yulwei looked over at them. “They will not see us, nor hear us either, unless you start shouting in their ears. We are safe.” He turned and walked on, giving the soldiers a wide berth. Ferro followed, still keeping low and quiet, if only out of habit.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">As Ferro came closer she began to make out the words of the soldier’s conversation. She slowed, listening. She turned. She started to move towards the fire. Yulwei looked round. “What are you doing?” he asked.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Ferro looked at the three of them. A big, tough-looking veteran, a thin, weaselly type, and an honest-seeming young man, who didn’t look much like a soldier. Their weapons were lying around, sheathed, wrapped up, unready. She circled them warily, listening.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They say she’s not right in the head,” the thin one was whispering at the young one, trying to scare him, “they say she’s killed a hundred men, or more. If you’re a good looking fella, she cuts your fruits off while you’re still alive,” he grabbed hold of his crotch, “and eats them in front of you!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, stop your mouth,” said the big one, “she won’t be coming near us.” He pointed over to where the fires were sparser, his voice dropping to a whisper. “She’ll be going to </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">him</span></span><span class="calibre3">, if she comes this way at all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, I hope she doesn’t,” said the young one, “live and let live, say I.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The thin man frowned. “And what about all the good men she’s killed? And women and children too? Shouldn’t they have been let live?” Ferro’s teeth ground together. She’d never killed children, that she could think of.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, it’s a shame for them, of course. I’m not saying she shouldn’t be caught.” The young soldier glanced around nervously. “Just maybe not by us.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The big man let go a laugh at that, but the thin one didn’t look amused. “You a coward?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No!” said the young man, angrily, “but I got a wife and a family depending on me, and I could do without being killed out here, that’s all.” He grinned. “We’re expecting another child. Hoping for a son this time.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The big man nodded. “My son’s nearly grown now. They get old so quick.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Talk of children, and families, and hopes only made the fury in Ferro’s chest squeeze harder. Why should they be allowed a life, when she had nothing? When them and their kind had taken everything from her? She slid the curved knife out of its sheath.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What are you doing, Ferro?” hissed Yulwei.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The young man looked round. “Did you hear something?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The big one laughed. “I think I heard you shit yourself.” The thin one chuckled to himself, the young man smiled, embarrassed. Ferro crept right up behind him. She was just a foot or two away, brightly lit by the fire, but none of the soldiers even glanced at her. She raised the knife.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ferro!” shouted Yulwei. The young man sprang to his feet, he peered out across the dark plain, squinting, brow furrowed. He looked Ferro right in the face, but his eyes were focused far behind her. She could smell his breath. The blade of the knife glittered an inch or less from his stubbly throat.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Now. Now was the time. She could kill him quickly, and take the other two as well before the alarm was raised. She knew she could do it. They were unprepared, and she was ready. Now was the time.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But her hand didn’t move.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What’s got up your arse?” asked the big soldier. “There’s nothing out there.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Could’ve sworn I heard something,” said the young man, still looking right in her face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Wait!” shouted the thin one, jumping to his feet and pointing. “There she is! Right in front of you!” Ferro froze for an instant, staring at him, then he and the big man started to laugh. The young soldier looked sheepish, turned around and sat down.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I thought I heard something, that’s all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There’s no one out there,” said the big man. Ferro began to back slowly away. She felt sick, her mouth full of sour spit, her head thumping. She pushed the knife back into its sheath, turned and stumbled off with Yulwei following silently behind.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">When the light of the fires and the sound of the talking had faded into the distance she stopped and dropped down on the hard ground. A cold wind blew up across the barren plain. It blew stinging dust in her face, but she hardly noticed. The hate and the fury were gone, for the time being, but they had left a hole, and she had nothing else to fill it with. She felt empty and cold and sick and alone. She hugged herself, rocking slowly back and forth, and closed her eyes. But the darkness held no comfort.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Then she felt the old man’s hand press onto her shoulder.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Now normally she would have twisted away, thrown him off, killed him if she could. But the strength was all gone. She looked up, blinking. “There’s nothing left of me. What am I?” She pressed one hand on her chest, but she barely felt it. “I have nothing inside.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well. It’s strange that you should say that.” Yulwei smiled up at the starry sky. “I was just starting to think there might be something in there worth saving.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_22"></div></div></body>

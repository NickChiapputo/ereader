<div id="filepos302041" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> On the List</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Why do I do this?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The outline of Villem dan Robb’s townhouse was cut out in black against the clear night sky. It was an unremarkable building, a two-storey-dwelling with a low wall and a gate in front, just like a hundred others in this street. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Our old friend Rews used to live in a palatial great villa near the market. Robb really should have asked him for some more ambitious bribes. Still. Lucky for us he didn’t.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Elsewhere in the city the fashionable avenues would be brightly lit and busy with drunken revellers right through until dawn. But this secluded side street was far from the bright lights and the prying eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">We can work undisturbed.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Round the side of the building, on the upper floor, a lamp was burning in a narrow window. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Good. Our friend is at home. But still awake—we must tread gently.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He turned to Practical Frost and pointed down the side of the house. The albino nodded and slipped away silently across the street.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta waited for him to reach the wall and disappear into the shadows beside the building, then he turned to Severard and pointed at the front door. The eyes of the lanky Practical smiled at him for a moment, then he scuttled quickly away, staying low, rolled over the low wall and dropped without a sound onto the other side.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Perfect so far, but now I must move.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta wondered why he had come. Frost and Severard were more than capable of dealing with Robb by themselves, and he would only slow them down. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I might even fall on my arse and alert the idiot to our presence. So why did I come?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> But Glokta knew why. The feeling of excitement was already building in his throat. It felt almost like being alive.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He had muffled the end of his cane with a bit of rag, so he was able to limp to the wall, ever so delicately, without making too much noise. By that time Severard had swung the gate open, holding the hinge with one gloved hand so that it didn’t make a noise. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Nice and neat. That little wall might as well be a hundred feet high for all my chances of getting over it.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Severard was kneeling on the step against the front door, picking the lock. His ear was close to the wood, his eyes squinting with concentration, gloved hands moving deftly. Glokta’s heart was beating fast, his skin prickly with tension. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Ah, the thrill of the hunt.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a soft click, then another. Severard slipped his glittering picks into a pocket, then reached out and slowly, carefully turned the doorknob. The door swung silently open. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">What a useful fellow he is. Without him and Frost I am just a cripple. They are my hands, my arms, my legs. But I am their brains.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Severard slipped inside and Glokta followed him, wincing with pain every time he put his weight on his left leg.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The hallway was dark, but there was a shaft of light spilling down the stairs from above and the banisters cast strange, distorted shadows on the wooden floor. Glokta pointed up the steps, and Severard nodded and began to tiptoe toward them, keeping his feet close to the wall. It seemed to take him an age to get there.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The third step made a quiet creaking sound as he put his weight on it. Glokta winced, Severard froze in place. They waited, still as statues. There was no sound from upstairs. Glokta began to breathe again. Severard moved ever so slowly upwards, step by gentle step. As he got towards the top he peered cautiously round the corner, back pressed against the wall, then he took the last step and disappeared from view without a sound.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Practical Frost emerged from the shadows at the far end of the corridor. Glokta raised an eyebrow at him but he shook his head. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Nobody downstairs.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He turned to the front door and started to close it, ever so gently. Only when it was shut did he slowly, slowly release the doorknob, so the latch slid silently into place.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’ll want to see this.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta gave a start at the sudden sound, turning round quickly and causing a jolt of pain to shoot through his back. Severard was standing, hands on hips, at the head of the stairs. He turned and made off towards the light, and Frost bounded up the steps after him, no longer making any pretence at stealth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Why can no one ever stay on the ground floor? Always upstairs.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> At least he didn’t have to try to be quiet as he struggled up the steps after his Practicals, right foot creaking, left foot scraping on the boards. Bright lamplight was flooding out into the upstairs corridor from an open door at the far end, and Glokta limped toward it. He paused as he crossed the threshold, catching his breath after the climb.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Oh dear me, what a mess.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> A big bookcase had been torn away from the wall, and books were scattered, open and closed, all about the floor. A glass of wine had been knocked over on the desk, making sodden red rags of the crumpled papers strewn across it. The bed was in disarray, the covers pulled half off, the pillows and the mattress slashed and spilling feathers. A wardrobe had its doors open, one of them dangling half off. A few tattered garments were hanging inside, but most were lying torn in a heap below.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A handsome young man lay on his back under the window, staring up, pale-faced and open mouthed at the ceiling. It would have been an understatement to say that his throat had been cut. It had been hacked so savagely that his head was only just still attached. There was blood splattered everywhere, on the torn clothes, on the slashed mattress, all over the body itself. There were a couple of smeared, bloody palm-prints on the wall, a great pool of blood across a good part of the floor, still wet. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">He was killed tonight. Perhaps only a few hours ago. Perhaps only a few minutes.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I don’t think he’ll be answering our questions,” said Severard.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No.” Glokta’s eyes drifted over the wreckage. “I think he might be dead. But how did it happen?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Frost fixed him with a pink eye and raised a white eyebrow. “Poithon?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Severard spluttered with shrill laughter under his mask. Even Glokta allowed himself a chuckle. “Clearly. But how did our poison get in?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Open wi’ow,” mumbled Frost, pointing at the floor.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta limped into the room, careful not to let his feet or his cane touch the sticky mess of blood and feathers. “So, our poison saw the lamp burning, just as we did. He entered via the downstairs window. He climbed silently up the stairs.” Glokta turned the corpse’s hands over with the tip of his cane. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A few specks of blood from the neck, but no damage to the knuckles or the fingers. He did not struggle. He was taken by surprise.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He craned forward and peered at the gaping wound.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A single, powerful cut. Probably with a knife.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And Villem dan Robb has sprung a most serious leak,” said Severard.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And we are short one informant,” mused Glokta. There had been no blood in the corridor. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Our man took pains not to get his feet wet while searching the room, however messy it may look. He was not angry or afraid. It was just a job.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The killer was a professional,” murmured Glokta, “he came here with murder in mind. Then perhaps he made this little effort to give the appearance of a burglary, who can say? Either way, the Arch Lector wont be satisfied with a corpse.” He looked up at his two Practicals. “Who’s next on the list?”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">This time there had been a struggle, without a doubt. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">If a onesided one.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Solimo Scandi was sprawled on his side, facing the wall, as though embarrassed by the state of his slashed and tattered nightshirt. There were deep cuts in his forearms. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Where he struggled vainly to ward off the blade.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He had crawled across the floor, leaving a bloody trail across the highly polished wood. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Where he struggled vainly to get away.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He had failed. The four gaping knife wounds in his back had been the end of him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta felt his face twitching as he looked down at the bloody corpse. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">One body might just be a coincidence. Two make a conspiracy.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> His eyelid fluttered. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Whoever did this knew we were coming, and when, and precisely who for. They are one step ahead of us. More than likely, our list of accomplices has already become a list of corpses.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> There was a creaking sound behind Glokta and his head whipped round, sending shooting pains down his stiff neck. Nothing but the open window swinging in the breeze. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Calm, now. Calm, and think it out.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It would seem the honourable Guild of Mercers have been doing a little housekeeping.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“How could they know?” muttered Severard.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">How indeed?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “They must have seen Rews’ list, or been told who was on it.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And that means…</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta licked at his empty gums. “Someone inside the Inquisition has been talking.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">For once, Severard’s eyes were not smiling. “If they know who’s on the list, they know who wrote it. They know who we are.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Three more names on the list, perhaps? Down at the bottom?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta grinned. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">How very exciting.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “You scared?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m not happy, I’ll tell you that.” He nodded down at the corpse. “A knife in the back isn’t part of my plan.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Nor mine, Severard, believe me.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">No indeed. If I die, I’ll never know who betrayed us.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And I want to know.</span></span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A bright, cloudless spring day, and the park was busy with fops and idlers of every variety. Glokta sat very still on his bench, in the merciful shade of a spreading tree, and stared out at the shimmering greenery, the sparkling water, the happy, the drunken, the colourful revellers. There were people wedged together on the benches around the lake, pairs and groups scattered around the grass, drinking and talking and basking in the sun. There seemed no space for any more.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But no one came and sat next to Glokta. Occasionally somebody would hurry up, hardly able to believe their luck in finding such a spot, then they would see him sitting there. Their faces would fall and they would swerve away, or walk right past as though they had never meant to sit. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I drive them away as surely as the plague, but perhaps that’s just as well. I don’t need their company.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He watched a group of young soldiers rowing a boat on the lake. One of them stood up, wobbling around, holding forth with a bottle in his hand. The boat rocked alarmingly, and his companions shouted at him to get down. Vague gales of good-natured laughter came wafting through the air, delayed a little by the distance. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Children. How young they look. How innocent. And such was I, not long ago. It seems a thousand years, though. Longer. It seems a different world.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Glokta.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He looked up, shading his eyes with his hand. It was Arch Lector Sult, arrived at last, a tall dark shape against the blue sky. Glokta thought he looked a little more tired, more lined, more drawn than usual as he stared coldly down.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“This had better be interesting.” Sult flicked out the tails of his long white coat and lowered himself gracefully onto the bench. “The commoners are up in arms again near Keln. Some idiot of a landowner hangs a few peasants and now we have a mess to deal with! How hard can it be to manage a field full of dirt and a couple of farmers? You don’t have to treat them well, just as long as you don’t hang them!” His mouth was a straight, hard line as he glared out across the lawns. “This had better be damned interesting.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Then I’ll try not to disappoint you.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Villem dan Robb is dead.” As though to add emphasis to Glokta’s statement, the drunken soldier slipped and toppled over the side of the boat, splashing into the water. His friends’ screams of laughter reached Glokta a moment later. “He was murdered.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh. It happens. Pick up the next man on the list.” Sult got to his feet, frowning. “I didn’t think you’d need my approval for every little thing. That’s why I picked you for this job. Just get on with it!” he snapped as he turned away.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">There’s no need to rush, Arch Lector. That’s the trouble with good legs, you tend to run around too much. If you have trouble moving, on the other hand, you don’t move until you damn well know it’s time.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “The next man on the list also suffered a mishap.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sult turned back, one eyebrow slightly raised. “He did?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They all did.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector pursed his lips, sat back down on the bench. “All of them?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“All of them.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hmm,” mused Sult. “That is interesting. The Mercers are cleaning up, are they? I hardly expected such ruthlessness. Times have changed, alright, times have certainly…” He trailed off, slowly starting to frown. “You think someone gave them Rews’ list, don’t you? You think one of ours has been talking. That’s why you asked me to come here, isn’t it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Did you think I was just avoiding the stairs?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Each one of them killed? Each and every name on our list? The very night we go to arrest them? I am not a great believer in coincidences.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Are you, Arch Lector?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was evidently not. His face had turned very grim. “Who saw the confession?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Me, and my two Practicals, of course.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You have absolute confidence in them?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Absolute.” There was a pause. The boat was drifting, rudderless, as the soldiers scrambled about, oars sticking up in the air, the man in the water splashing and laughing, spraying water over his friends.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The confession was in my office for some time,” murmured the Arch Lector. “Some members of my staff could have seen it. Could have.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You have absolute confidence in them, your Eminence?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sult stared at Glokta for a long, icy moment. “They wouldn’t dare. They know me better than that.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That leaves Superior Kalyne,” said Glokta quietly.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector’s lips hardly moved as he spoke. “You must tread carefully, Inquisitor, very carefully. The ground is not at all safe where you are walking. Fools do not become Superiors of the Inquisition, despite appearances. Kalyne has many friends, both within the House of Questions and outside it. Powerful friends. Any accusation against him must be backed up by the very strongest of proof.” Sult stopped suddenly, waiting for a small group of ladies to pass out of earshot. “The very strongest of proof,” he hissed, once they had moved away. “You must find me this assassin.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Easier said than done.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Of course, your Eminence, but my investigation has reached something of a dead end.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not quite. We still have one card left to play. Rews himself.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Rews?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “But, Arch Lector, he will be in Angland by now.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Sweating down a mine or some such. If he has even lasted this long.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No. He is here in the Agriont, under lock and key. I thought it best to hold on to him.” Glokta did his utmost to contain his surprise. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Clever. Very clever. Fools do not become Arch Lectors either, it seems.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Rews will be your bait. I will have my secretary carry a message to Kalyne, letting him know that I have relented. That I am prepared to let the Mercers continue to operate, but under tighter control. That as a gesture of goodwill I have let Rews go. If Kalyne is the source of our leak, I daresay he will let the Mercers know that Rews is free. I daresay they will send this assassin to punish him for his loose tongue. I daresay you could take him while he is trying. If the killer doesn’t come, well, we might have to look for our traitor elsewhere, and we have lost nothing.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“An excellent plan, your Eminence.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sult stared at him coldly. “Of course. You will need somewhere to operate, somewhere far from the House of Questions. I will make the funds available, have Rews delivered to your Practicals, and let you know when Kalyne has the information. Find me this assassin, Glokta, and squeeze him. Squeeze him until the pips squeak.” The boat lurched wildly as the soldiers tried to haul their wet companion in, then it suddenly turned right over, dumping them all into the water.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I want names,” hissed Sult, glowering at the splashing soldiers, “I want names, and evidence, and documents, and people who will stand up in Open Council and point fingers.” He stood up smoothly from the bench. “Keep me informed.” He strode off towards the House of Questions, feet crunching on the gravel of the path, and Glokta watched him go. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">An excellent plan. I’m glad you’re on my side, Arch Lector. You are on my side, aren’t you?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The soldiers had succeeded in hauling the upended boat onto the bank and were standing, dripping wet, shouting at one another, no longer so good-humoured. One of the oars was still floating, abandoned in the water, drifting gradually towards the point where the stream flowed from the lake. Soon it would pass under the bridge and be carried out, beneath the great walls of the Agriont and into the moat. Glokta watched it turning slowly round in the water. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A mistake. One should attend to the details. It is easy to forget the little things, but without the oar, the boat is useless.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He let his gaze wander across some of the other faces in the park. His eye alighted on a handsome pair sitting on a bench by the lake. The young man was speaking quietly to the girl, a sad and earnest expression on his face. She got up quickly, moving away from him with her hands over her face. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Ah, the pain of the jilted lover. The loss, the anger, the shame. It seems as though you’ll never recover. What poet was it who wrote there’s no pain worse than the pain of a broken heart? Sentimental shit. He should have spent more time in the Emperor’s prisons.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He smiled, opening his mouth and licking the empty gums where his front teeth used to be. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Broken hearts heal with time, but broken teeth never do.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta looked at the young man. He had an expression of slight amusement on his face as he watched the weeping girl walk away. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The young bastard. I wonder if he’s broken as many hearts as I did, in my youth? It hardly seems possible now. It takes me half an hour just to pluck up the courage to stand. The only women I’ve made cry lately have been the wives of those I’ve had exiled to Angland—</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Sand.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta turned around. “Lord Marshal Varuz, what an honour.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh no, no,” said the old soldier, sitting down on the bench with the swift, precise movements of the fencing master. “You look well,” he said, but without really looking. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I look crippled, you mean.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “How are you, my old friend?” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I’m crippled, you pompous old ass. And friend, is it? All those years since I came back, and you have never sought me out, not once. Is that a friendship?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well enough, thank you, Lord Marshal.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Varuz shifted uncomfortably on the bench. “My latest student, Captain Luthar… perhaps you know him?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We are acquainted.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You should see his forms.” Varuz shook his head sadly. “He has the talent, alright, though he will never be in your class, Sand.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I don’t know. I hope some day he’ll be just as crippled as I am.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “But he has plenty of talent, enough to win. Only he’s wasting it. Throwing it away.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Oh, the tragedy of it. I am so upset I could be sick. Had I eaten anything this morning.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He is lazy, Sand, and stubborn. He lacks courage. He lacks dedication. His heart is just not in it, and time is running out. I was wondering, if you have the time of course,” Varuz looked Glokta in the eye for just an instant, “whether you might be able to speak to him for me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I can hardly wait! Lecturing that whining ass would be the realisation of all my dreams. You arrogant old dolt, how dare you? You built your reputation on my successes, then when I needed your help you cut me off. And now you come to me, and seek my help, and call me friend?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course, Marshal Varuz, I would be glad to speak to him. Anything for an old friend.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Excellent, excellent! I’m sure you’ll make all the difference! I train him every morning, in that courtyard near the House of the Maker, where I used to train you…” The old Marshal trailed off awkwardly.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I will come as soon as my duties permit.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course, your duties…” Varuz was already getting up, evidently keen to be on his way. Glokta held out his hand, making the old soldier pause for a moment. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">You needn’t worry, Lord Marshal, I am not contagious.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Varuz gave it a limp shake, as though worried it might snap off, then he mumbled his excuses and strode away, head held high. The dripping soldiers bowed and saluted as he walked past, somewhat embarrassed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta stretched out his leg, wondering whether to get up. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And go where? The world will not end if I sit here a moment longer. There is no rush. No rush.</span></span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_13"></div></div></body>

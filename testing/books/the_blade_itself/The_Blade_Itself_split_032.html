<div id="filepos851548" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Nobility</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal scraped the last fair hairs from the side of his jaw and washed the razor off in the bowl. Then he wiped it on the cloth, closed it and placed it carefully on the table, admiring the way the sunlight glinted on the mother-of-pearl handle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He wiped his face, and then—his favourite part of the day—gazed at himself in the looking glass. It was a good one, newly imported from Visserine, a present from his father: an oval of bright, smooth glass in a frame of lavishly-carved dark wood. A fitting surround for such a handsome man as the one gazing happily back at him. Honestly, handsome hardly did him justice.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re quite the beauty aren’t you?” Jezal said to himself, smiling as he ran his fingers over the smooth skin of his jaw. And what a jaw it was. He had often been told it was his best feature, not that there was anything whatever wrong with the rest of him. He turned to the right, then to the left, the better to admire that magnificent chin. Not too heavy, not brutish, but not too light either, not womanly or weak. A man’s jaw, no doubt, with a slight cleft in the chin, speaking of strength and authority, but sensitive and thoughtful too. Had there ever been a jaw like it? Perhaps some king, or hero of legend, once had one almost as fine. It was a noble jaw, that much was clear. No commoner could ever have had a chin so grand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It must have come from his mother’s side of the family, Jezal supposed. His father had rather a weak chin. His brothers too, come to think of it. You had to feel a little sorry for them, he had got all the looks in his family.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And most of the talent too,” he murmured happily to himself. He turned away from the mirror with some reluctance, striding into his living room, pulling his shirt on and buttoning it up the front. He had to look his best today. The thought gave him a little shiver of nerves, starting in his stomach, creeping up his windpipe, lodging in his throat.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">By now, the gates would be open. A steady flood of people would be filing into the Agriont, taking their seats on the great wooden benches in the Square of Marshals. Thousands of them. Everyone who was anyone, and plenty more who weren’t. They were already gathering: shouting, jostling, excited, waiting for… him. Jezal coughed and tried to push the thought from his mind. He had kept himself awake with it for half the night already.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He moved over to the table, where the breakfast tray was sitting. He picked up a sausage absently in his fingertips and took a bite off the end, chewing it without relish. He wrinkled his nose and tossed it back in the dish. He had no appetite this morning. He was just wiping his fingers on the cloth when he noticed something lying on the floor by the door, a slip of paper. He bent and picked it up, unfolded it. A single line, written in a neat, precise hand:</span></p><p class="calibre2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Meet me tonight, at the statue of Harod the Great near the Four Corners</span></span></p><p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">—</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A.</span></span></p><p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">“Shit,” he murmured, disbelieving, reading the line over and over. He folded the paper shut, glancing nervously round the room. Jezal could only think of one “A”. He had pushed her to the back of his mind the last couple of days, he had been spending every spare moment training. This brought it all back though, and no mistake.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shit!” He opened the paper and read the line again. Meet me tonight? He could not escape a slight flush of satisfaction at that, and it slowly became a very distinct glow of pleasure. His mouth curled into a gormless grin. Secret meetings in the darkness? His skin prickled with excitement at the prospect. But secrets have a way of coming to the surface, and what if her brother found out? That thought brought on a fresh rush of nerves. He took the slip of paper in both hands, ready to tear it in half, but at the last moment he folded it instead, and slipped it into his pocket.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">As Jezal made his way down the tunnel he could already hear the crowd. A strange, echoing murmur, seeming to come out of the very stones. He had heard it before, of course, as a spectator at last year’s Contest, but it hadn’t made his skin sweat and his guts turn over then. Being part of the audience is a world away from being part of the show.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He slowed for a moment, then stopped, closing his eyes and leaning against the wall, the noise of the crowd rushing in his ears, trying to breathe deep and compose himself.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Don’t worry, I know just how you feel.” Jezal felt West’s consoling hand on his shoulder. “I nearly turned around and ran the first time, but it’ll pass as soon as the steels are drawn, believe me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes,” mumbled Jezal, “of course.” He doubted that West knew exactly how he felt. The man might have been through a couple of Contests before, but Jezal thought it unlikely he had been considering a surreptitious meeting with his best friend’s sister the same night. He wondered whether West would be quite so considerate if he knew the contents of the letter in Jezal’s breast pocket. It did not seem likely.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We’d better get moving. Wouldn’t want them to start without us.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No.” Jezal took one last deep breath, opened his eyes and blew out hard. Then he pushed himself away from the wall and strode rapidly down the tunnel. He felt a sudden surge of panic—where were his steels? He cast about him desperately, then breathed a long sigh. They were in his hand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was quite a crowd in the hall at the far end: trainers, seconds, friends, family members and hangers-on. You could tell who the contestants were, though; the fifteen young men with steels clutched tightly in their hands. The sense of fear was palpable, and contagious. Everywhere Jezal looked he saw pale, nervous faces, sweaty foreheads, anxious eyes darting around. It wasn’t helped by the noise of the crowd, ominously loud beyond the closed double doors at the far end of the room, swelling and subsiding like a stormy sea.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was only one man there who didn’t seem at all bothered by the occasion, leaning against the wall on his own with one foot up on the plaster and his head tipped back, staring down his nose at the assembly through barely open eyes. Most of the contestants were lithe, stringy, athletic. He was anything but. A big, heavy man with hair shaved to dark stubble. He had a great thick neck and a doorstep of a jaw—the jaw of a commoner, Jezal rather thought, but a large and powerful commoner with a mean streak. Jezal might have taken him for someone’s servant but that he had a pair of steels dangling loosely from one hand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gorst,” West whispered in Jezal’s ear.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh. Looks more like a labourer than a swordsman to me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Maybe, but looks can lie.” The sound of the crowd was slowly fading, and the nervy chatter within the room subsided along with it. West raised his eyebrows. “The King’s address,” he whispered.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“My friends! My countrymen! My fellow citizens of the Union!” came a ringing voice, clearly audible even through the heavy doors.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hoff,” snorted West. “Even here he takes the King’s place. Why doesn’t he just put the crown on and have done with it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“One month ago today,” came the far-off bellow of the Lord Chamberlain, “fellows of mine on the Closed Council put forward the question… should there be a Contest this year?” Boos and shouts of wild disapproval were heard from the crowd. “A fair question!” cried Hoff, “for we are at war! A deadly struggle in the North! The very liberties which we hold so dear, the very freedoms which make us the envy of the world, our very way of life, stand threatened by the savage!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A clerk began making his way around the room, separating the contestants from their families, their trainers, their friends. “Good luck,” said West, clapping Jezal on the shoulder, “I’ll see you out there.” Jezal’s mouth was dry, and he could only nod.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And these were brave men who asked the question!” Boomed out Hoffs voice from beyond the doors. “Wise men! Patriots all! My stalwart colleagues on the Closed Council! I understood why they might think, there should be no Contest this year!” There was a long pause. “But I said to them, no!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">An eruption of manic cheering. “No! No!” screamed the crowd. Jezal was ushered into line along with the other contestants, two abreast, eight pairs. He fussed with his steels as the Lord Chamberlain droned on, though he’d checked them twenty times already.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No, I said to them! Should we allow these barbarians, these animals of the frozen North, to tread upon our way of life? Should we allow this beacon of freedom amidst the darkness of the world to be extinguished? No, I said to them! Our liberty is not for sale at any price! On this, my friends, my countrymen, my fellow citizens of the Union, on this you may depend… we will win this war!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Another great ocean swell of approval. Jezal swallowed, glanced nervously around. Bremer dan Gorst was standing there beside him. The big bastard had the temerity to wink, grinning as if he hadn’t a care in the world. “Damn idiot,” whispered Jezal, but he took care that his lips didn’t move.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And so, my friends, and so,” came Hoff’s final cries, “what finer occasion could there be than when we stand upon the very brink of peril? To celebrate the skill, the strength, the prowess, of some of our nation’s bravest sons! My fellow citizens, my countrymen of the Union, I give you your contestants!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The doors were heaved open and the roar of the crowd beyond rushed into the hall and made the rafters ring: suddenly, deafeningly loud. The front pair of swordsmen began to stride out through the bright archway, then the next pair, then the next. Jezal was sure he would freeze, motionless and staring like a rabbit, but when his turn came his feet stepped off manfully next to Gorst’s, the heels of his highly polished boots clicking across the tiled floor and through the high doorway.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Square of Marshals was transformed. All around, great banks of seating had been erected, stretching back, and back, and up, and up on all sides, spilling over with a boiling multitude. The contestants filed down a deep valley between the towering stands towards the centre of this great arena, the beams, and struts, and tree-trunk supports like a shadowy forest on either side. Directly before them, seeming very far away, the fencing circle had been laid, a little ring of dry yellow grass in the midst of a sea of faces.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Down near the front Jezal could make out the features of the rich and noble. Dressed in their best, shading their eyes from the bright sun, on the whole fashionably disinterested in the spectacle before them. Further back, higher up, the figures became less distinct, the clothes less fine. The vast majority of the crowd were mere blobs and specks of colour, crammed in around the distant edge of the dizzying bowl, but the commoners made up for their distance with their excitement: cheering, shouting, standing up on their toes and waving their arms in the air. Above them, the tops of the very highest buildings around the square peered over, walls and roofs sticking up like islands in the ocean, the windows and parapets crammed with minuscule onlookers.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal blinked at this great display of humanity. Part of him was aware that his mouth was hanging open, but too small a part to close it. Damn, he felt queasy. He knew he should have eaten something, but it was too late now. What if he puked, right here in front of half the world? He felt that surge of blind panic again. Where did he leave his steels? Where were they? In his hand. In his hand. The crowd roared, and sighed, and wailed, with a myriad of different voices.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The contestants began to move away from the circle. Not all of them would be fighting today, most would only watch. As though there was a need for extra spectators. They began to make their way towards the front rows, but Jezal was not going with them, more was the pity. He made for the enclosures where the contestants prepared to fight.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He flopped down heavily next to West, closed his eyes and wiped his sweaty forehead as the crowd cheered on. Everything was too bright, too loud, too overpowering. Marshal Varuz was nearby, leaning over the side of the enclosure to shout in someone’s ear. Jezal stared across the arena at the occupants of the royal box opposite, hoping vainly for a distraction.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“His Majesty the King seems to be enjoying the proceedings,” whispered West in Jezal’s ear.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Mmm.” The King, in fact, appeared already to have fallen soundly asleep, his crown slipping off at an angle. Jezal wondered idly what would happen if it fell off.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Crown Prince Ladisla was there, fabulously dressed as always, beaming around at the arena with an enormous smile as though everyone was there for him. His younger brother, Prince Raynault, could hardly have looked more different: plain and sober, frowning worriedly at his semi-conscious father. Their mother, the Queen, sat beside them, bolt upright with her chin in the air, studiously pretending that her august husband was wide awake, and that his crown was in no danger of dropping suddenly and painfully into her lap. Between her and Lord Hoff, Jezal’s eye was caught by a young woman—very, very beautiful. She was even more expensively dressed than Ladisla, if that was possible, with a chain of huge diamonds round her neck, flashing bright in the sun.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who’s the woman?” asked Jezal.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, the Princess Terez,” murmured West. “The daughter of Grand Duke Orso, Lord of Talins. She’s quite the celebrated beauty, and for once it seems that rumour doesn’t exaggerate.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I thought nothing good ever came from Talins.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So I’ve heard, but I think she might be the exception, don’t you?” Jezal was not entirely convinced. Spectacular, no doubt, but there was an icy proud look to her eye. “I think the Queen has it in mind that she marry Prince Ladisla.” As Jezal watched, the Crown Prince leant across his mother to favour the Princess with some witless banter, then exploded into laughter at his own joke, slapping his knee with merriment. She gave a frosty little smile, radiating contempt even at this distance. Ladisla seemed not to notice though, and Jezal’s attention was soon distracted. A tall man in a red coat was striding ponderously towards the circle. The referee.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It’s time,” murmured West.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The referee held up his arm with a theatrical flourish, two fingers extended, and turned slowly around, waiting for the hubbub to subside. “Today you will have the pleasure of witnessing </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">two</span></span><span class="calibre3"> bouts of fencing!” he thundered, then thrust up his other hand, three fingers out, as the audience applauded. “Each the best of </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">three</span></span><span class="calibre3"> touches!” He threw up both arms. “</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Four</span></span><span class="calibre3"> men will fight before you! Two of them will go home… empty handed.” The referee let one arm drop, shook his head sadly, the crowd sighed. “But two will pass on to the next round!” The crowd bellowed their approval.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ready?” asked Marshal Varuz, leaning forwards over Jezal’s shoulder.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">What a damn fool question. What if he wasn’t ready? What then? Call the whole thing off? Sorry everyone, I’m not ready? See you next year? But all Jezal could say was, “Mmm.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The time has come!” cried the referee, turning slowly around in the centre of the arena, “for our first bout!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Jacket!” snapped Varuz.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Uh.” Jezal rumbled with the buttons and pulled his jacket off, rolling up his shirt-sleeves mechanically. He glanced sideways and saw his opponent making similar preparations. A tall, thin young man with long arms and weak, slightly dewy eyes. Hardly the most intimidating looking of adversaries. Jezal noticed his hands were trembling slightly as he took his steels from his second.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Trained by Sepp dan Vissen, and hailing from Rostod, in Starikland…” the referee paused for the greatest effect “…Kurtis dan Broya!” There was a wave of enthusiastic clapping. Jezal snorted. These clowns would clap for anyone.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The tall young man got up from his seat and walked purposefully towards the circle, his steels flashing in the sunlight. “Broya!” repeated the referee, as the gangly idiot took his mark. West pulled Jezal’s steels from their sheaths. The metallic ringing of the blades made him want to be sick again.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The referee pointed once more towards the contestant’s enclosure. “And his opponent today! An officer of the King’s Own, and trained by none other than Lord Marshal Varuz!” There was scattered applause and the old soldier beamed happily. “Hailing from Luthar in Midderland but resident here in the Agriont… Captain Jezal dan Luthar!” Another surge of cheering, far louder than Broya had received. There was a flurry of sharp cries above the din. Shouted numbers. Odds being offered. Jezal felt another rush of nausea as he got slowly to his feet.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good luck.” West handed Jezal his naked steels, hilts first.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He doesn’t need luck!” snapped Varuz. “This Broya’s a nobody! Just watch his reach! Press him, Jezal, press him!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It seemed to take forever to reach that ring of short dry grass, the sound of the crowd loud in Jezal’s ears but the sound of his heart louder still, turning the grips of his steels round and round in his sweaty palms. “Luthar!” repeated the referee, smiling wide as he watched Jezal approach.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Pointless and irrelevant questions flitted in and out of his mind. Was Ardee watching, in the crowd, wondering whether he would come to meet her that night? Would he get killed in the war? How did they get the grass for the fencing circle into the Square of Marshals? He glanced up at Broya. Was he feeling the same way? The crowd was quiet now, very quiet. The weight of the silence pressed down on Jezal as he took his mark in the circle, pushed his feet into the dry earth. Broya shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, raised his steels. Jezal needed to piss. Needed to piss so badly. What if he pissed himself right now? A big dark stain spreading across his trousers. The man who pissed himself at the Contest. He would never live it down, not if he lived a hundred years.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Begin!” thundered the referee.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But nothing happened. The two men stood there, facing each other, steels at the ready. Jezal’s eyebrow itched. He wanted to scratch it, but how? His opponent licked his lips, then took a cautious step to his left. Jezal did the same. They circled each other warily, shoes crunching gently on the dry grass: slowly, slowly drawing closer together. And as they came closer, Jezal’s world contracted to the space between the points of their long steels. Now it was only a stride. Now it was a foot. Now just six inches separated them. Jezal’s whole mind was focused on those two glittering points. Three inches. Broya jabbed forward, weakly, and Jezal flicked it away without thinking.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The blades rang gently together and, as though that were a signal prearranged with every person in the arena, the shouting began again, scattered calls to begin with:</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Kill him, Luthar!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Jab! Jab!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But soon dissolving once more into the rumbling, angry sea of the crowd, rising and falling with the movements in the circle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The more Jezal saw of this lanky idiot, the less daunted he became. His nerves began to subside. Broya jabbed, clumsy, and Jezal barely had to move. Broya cut, without conviction, and Jezal parried, without effort. Broya lunged, positively inept, off-balance and overextended. Jezal stepped around it and jabbed his opponent in the ribs with the blunt point of his long steel. It was all so very easy.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“One for Luthar!” cried the referee, and a surge of cheering ran around the stands. Jezal smiled to himself, basking in the appreciation of the crowd. Varuz had been right, this boob was nothing to worry about. One more touch and he’d be through to the next round.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He returned to his mark and Broya did the same, rubbing his ribs with one hand and staring at Jezal balefully from beneath his brows. Jezal was not intimidated. Angry looks are only any use if you can fight worth a damn.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Begin!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They closed quickly this time, and exchanged a cut or two.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal could hardly believe how slowly his opponent was moving, it was as if his swords weighed a ton each. Broya fished around in the air with his long steel, trying to use his reach to pin Jezal down. He had barely used his short steel yet, let alone coordinated the two. Worse still, he was starting to look out of breath, and they’d barely been fencing two minutes. Had he trained at all, this bumpkin? Or had they simply made up the numbers with some servant off the street? Jezal jumped away, danced around his opponent. Broya flapped after him, dogged but incompetent. It was starting to become embarrassing. Nobody enjoys a mismatch, and this dunce’s clumsiness was denying Jezal the opportunity to shine.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh come on!” he shouted. A surge of laughter flowed around the stands. Broya gritted his teeth and came on with everything he had, but it wasn’t much. Jezal swatted his feeble efforts aside, dodged around them, flowed across the circle while his witless opponent lumbered after, always three steps behind. There was no precision, no speed, no thought. A few minutes before, Jezal had been half-terrified by the prospect of fencing with this gangling fool. Now he was almost bored.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Hah!” he cried, switching suddenly onto the attack, catching his opponent off-balance with a savage cut, sending him stumbling back. The crowd came alive, roaring their support. He jabbed and jabbed again. Broya blocked desperately, all off-balance, reeled backwards, parried one last time then tripped, his arms flailing, short steel flying out of his hand, and pitched out of the circle onto his arse.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a wave of laughter, and Jezal could not help but join in. The poor dolt looked quite amusing, knocked on his back with his legs in the air like some sort of turtle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Captain Luthar wins!” roared the referee, “two to nothing!” The laughter turned to jeering as Broya rolled over. He looked on the verge of tears, the oaf. Jezal stepped forwards and offered his hand, but found himself unable to entirely wipe the smirk off his face. His beaten adversary pointedly ignored his help, pushing himself up from the ground and giving him a look half hating, half hurt.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal shrugged pleasantly. “It’s not my fault you’re shit.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“More?” asked Kaspa, holding out the bottle in a wobbly hand, eyes misted over with too much booze.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No thanks.” Jezal pushed the bottle gently away before Kaspa had the chance to pour. He looked blearily bewildered for a moment, then he turned to Jalenhorm.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“More?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Always.” The big man slid his glass across the rough table top in a way that said, “I am not drunk”, though he clearly was. Kaspa lowered the bottle towards it, squinting at the glass as though it was a great distance away. Jezal watched the neck of the bottle wobbling in the air, then rattling on the edge of the glass. The inevitability of it was almost painful to behold. Wine spilled out across the table, splashing into Jalenhorm’s lap.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re drunk!” complained the big man, staggering to his feet and brushing at himself with big, drunken hands, knocking his stool over in the process. A few of the other patrons eyed their table with evident disdain.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Alwaysh,” giggled Kaspa.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West looked up briefly from his glass. “You’re both drunk.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not our fault.” Jalenhorm groped for his stool. “It’s him!” He pointed an unsteady finger at Jezal.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He won!” gurgled Kaspa. “You won, didn’t you, and now we got to celebrate!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal wished they didn’t have to celebrate quite so much. It was becoming embarrassing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“My cousin Ariss wa’ there—saw whole thing. She was ver’ impressed.” Kaspa flung his arm round Jezal’s shoulder. “Think she’s quite shmitten with you… shmitten… shmitten.” He worked his wet lips in Jezal’s face, trying to get his mouth round the word. “She’s ver’ rich you know, ver’ rich indeed. Shmitten.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal wrinkled his nose. He had not the slightest interest in that ghostly simpleton of a cousin, however rich she was, and Kaspa’s breath stank. “Good… lovely” He disentangled himself from the Lieutenant and shoved him away, none too gently.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So, when are we starting on this business in the North?” demanded Brint, a little too loud, as though he for one couldn’t wait to get underway. “Soon I hope, home before winter, eh, Major?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh,” snorted West, frowning to himself, “we’ll be lucky to have left before winter, the rate we’re going.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Brint looked a little taken aback. “Well, I’m sure we’ll give these savages a thrashing, whenever we get there.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Give ’em a thrashing!” cried Kaspa.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Aye.” Jalenhorm nodded his agreement.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West was not in the mood. “I wouldn’t be too sure about that. Have you seen the state of some of these levies? They can hardly walk, let alone fight. It’s a disgrace.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jalenhorm dismissed all this with an angry wave of his hand. “They’re nothing but fucking savages, the lot of ’em! We’ll knock ’em on their arses, like Jezal did that idiot today, eh, Jezal? Home before winter, everyone says so!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Do you know the land up there?” asked West, leaning across the table. “Forests, mountains, rivers, on and on. Precious little open space to fight in, precious few roads to march on. You’ve got to catch a man before the thrashing can start. Home before winter? Next winter, maybe, if we come back at all.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Brint’s eyes were wide open and horrified. “You can’t mean that!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No… no, you’re right.” West sighed and shook himself. “I’m sure it’ll all turn out fine. Glory and promotions all round. Home before winter. I’d take a coat with you though, just in case.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">An uneasy silence descended on the group. West had that hard frown on his face that he got sometimes, the frown that said they’d get no more fun out of him tonight. Brint and Jalenhorm looked puzzled and surly. Only Kaspa maintained his good humour, and he was lolling back in his chair, eyes half closed, blissfully unaware of his surroundings.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Some celebration.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal himself felt tired, annoyed, and worried. Worried about the Contest, worried about the war… worried about Ardee. The letter was still there, folded up in his pocket. He glanced sidelong at West, then quickly away. Damn, he felt guilty. He had never really felt guilty before, and he didn’t like it one bit. If he didn’t meet her, he would feel guilty for leaving her on her own. If he did, he’d feel guilty for breaking his word to West. It was a dilemma alright. Jezal chewed at his thumb-nail. What the hell was it about this damn family?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well,” said West sharply, “I have to be going. Early start tomorrow.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Mmm,” muttered Brint.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Right,” said Jalenhorm.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West looked Jezal right in the eye. “Can I have a word?” His expression was serious, grave, angry even. Jezal’s heart lurched. What if West had found out about the letter? What if Ardee had told him? The Major turned away, moved over towards a quiet corner. Jezal stared around, desperately seeking for some way out.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Jezal!” called West.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, yes.” He got up with the greatest reluctance and followed his friend, flashing what he hoped was an innocent-seeming smile. Perhaps it was something else. Nothing to do with Ardee. Please let it be something else.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I don’t want anyone else to know about this…” West looked round to make sure no one was watching. Jezal swallowed. Any moment now he would get a punch in the face. At least one. He had never been punched in the face, not properly. A girl slapped him pretty hard once, but that was hardly the same. He prepared himself as best he could, gritting his teeth, wincing slightly. “Burr has set a date. We’ve got four weeks.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal stared back. “What?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Until we embark.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Embark?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“For Angland, Jezal!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, yes… Angland, of course! Four weeks you say?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I thought you ought to know, since you’re busy with the Contest, so you’d have time to get ready. Keep it to yourself, though.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, of course.” Jezal wiped his sweaty forehead.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You alright? You look pale.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m fine, fine.” He took a deep breath. “All this excitement, you know, the fencing and… everything.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Don’t worry, you did well today.” West clapped him on the shoulder. “But there’s a lot more to do. Three more bouts before you can call yourself a champion, and they’ll only get harder. Don’t get lazy, Jezal—and don’t get too drunk!” he threw over his shoulder as he made for the door. Jezal breathed a long sigh of relief as he returned to the table where the others were sitting. His nose was still intact.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Brint had already started to complain, now he could see that West wasn’t coming back. “What the hell was all that?” he asked, frowning and jabbing his thumb at the door. “I mean to say, well, I know he’s supposed to be the big hero and all of that but, well, I mean to say!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal stared down at him. “What do you mean to say?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, to talk that way! It’s, it’s defeatist!” The drink was lending him courage now, and he was warming to his topic. “It’s… well, I mean to say… it’s cowardly talk is what it is!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Now, look here, Brint,” snapped Jezal, “he fought in three pitched battles, and he was first through the breach at Ulrioch! He may not be a nobleman, but he’s a damn courageous fellow! Added to that he knows soldiering, he knows Marshal Burr, and he knows Angland! What do you know, Brint?” Jezal curled his lip. “Except how to lose at cards and empty a wine bottle?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s all a man needs to know in my book,” laughed Jalenhorm nervously, doing his best to calm the situation. “More wine!” he bellowed at no one in particular.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal dropped down on his stool. If the company had been subdued before West left, it was even more so now. Brint was sulking. Jalenhorm was swaying on his stool. Kaspa had fallen soundly asleep, sprawled out on the wet table top, his breathing making quiet slurping sounds.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal drained his wine glass, and stared round at the unpromising faces. Damn, he was bored. It was a fact, he was only now beginning to realise, that the conversation of the drunk is only interesting to the drunk. A few glasses of wine can be the difference between finding a man a hilarious companion or an insufferable moron. He wondered if he himself was as tedious drunk as Kaspa, or Jalenhorm, or Brint.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal gave a thin smile as he looked over at the sulking bastard. If he were King, he mused, he would punish poor conversation with death, or at least a lengthy prison term. He stood up from his chair.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jalenhorm stared up at him. “What you doing?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Better get some rest,” snapped Jezal, “need to train tomorrow.” It was the most he could do not to just run out of the place.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But you won! Ain’t you going to celebrate?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“First round. I’ve still three more men to beat, and they’ll all be better than that oaf today.” Jezal took his coat from the back of the chair and pulled it over his shoulders.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Sult self,” said Jalenhorm, then slurped noisily from his glass.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Kaspa raised his head from the table for a moment, hair on one side plastered to his skull with spilled wine. “Going sho shoon?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Mmm,” said Jezal as he turned and stalked out.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a cold wind blowing in the street outside. It made him feel even more sober than before. Painfully sober. He badly needed some intelligent company, but where could he find it at this time of night? There was only one place he could think of.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He slipped the letter out of his pocket and read it in the dim light from the tavern’s windows, just one more time. If he hurried he might still catch her. He began to walk slowly towards the Four Corners. Just to talk, that was all. He needed someone to talk to…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">No. He forced himself to stop. Could he truly pretend that he wanted to be her friend? A friendship between a man and a woman was what you called it when one had been pursuing the other for a long time, and had never got anywhere. He had no interest in that arrangement.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">What then? Marriage? To a girl with no blood and no money? Unthinkable! He imagined bringing Ardee home to meet his family. Here is my new wife, father! Wife? And her connections are? He shuddered at the thought.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But what if they could find something in between, where everyone would be comfortable? His feet began slowly to move. Not friendship, not marriage, but some looser arrangement? He strode down the road towards the Four Corners. They could meet discreetly, and talk, and laugh, somewhere with a bed maybe…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">No. No. Jezal stopped again and slapped the side of his head in frustration. He couldn’t let that happen, even supposing she would. West was one thing, but what if other people found out? It wouldn’t hurt his reputation any, of course, but hers would be ruined. Ruined. His flesh crept at the thought. She didn’t deserve that, surely. It wasn’t good enough to say it was her problem. Not good enough. Just so he could have a little fun? The selfishness of it. He was amazed that it had never occurred to him before.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">So he had reasoned himself into a corner then, just as he had done ten times already today: nothing good could come from seeing her. They would be away to war soon anyway, and that would put an end to his ridiculous pining. Home to bed then, and train all day tomorrow. Train and train until Marshal Varuz had battered her out of his thoughts. He took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, turned and set off towards the Agriont.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The statue of Harod the Great loomed out of the darkness on a marble plinth almost as tall as Jezal, seeming far too big and grand for its quiet little square near the Four Corners. He had been jumping at shadows all the way here, avoiding people, doing his best to be inconspicuous. There weren’t many people around though. It was late, and most likely Ardee would have given up waiting a long time ago, provided she was even there to begin with.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He crept nervously around the statue, peering into the shadows, feeling an absolute fool. He had walked through this square many times before and never given it a second thought. Was it not a public space after all? He had as much right as anyone to be here, but somehow he still felt like a thief.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The square was empty. That was a good thing. All for the best. There was nothing to gain, everything to lose, and so forth. So why did he feel so completely crushed? He stared up at Harod’s face, locked into that stony frown that sculptors reserve for the truly great. He had a fine, strong jaw, did Harod, almost the equal of Jezal’s own.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Wake up!” hissed a voice by his ear. Jezal let vent to a girlish squeal, scrambled away, tripped, only stayed upright by clawing at King Harod’s enormous foot. There was a dark figure behind him, a hooded figure.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Laughter. “No need to piss yourself.” Ardee. She pushed back her hood. Light from a window slanted across the bottom part of her face, catching her lop-sided smile. “It’s only me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I didn’t see you,” he mumbled pointlessly, quickly releasing his desperate grip on the huge stone foot and doing his best to appear at ease. He had to admit it was a poor start. He had no talent for this cloak-and-dagger business. Ardee seemed quite comfortable, though. It made him wonder whether she hadn’t done it all before.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’ve been pretty hard to see yourself, lately,” she said.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, er,” he muttered, heart still thumping from the shock, “I’ve been busy, what with the Contest and all…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, the all-important Contest. I saw you fight today.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You did?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Very impressive.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Er, thank you, I—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“My brother said something, didn’t he?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What, about fencing?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No, numbskull. About me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal paused, trying to work out the best way to answer that one. “Well he—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Are you scared of him?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No!” Silence. “Alright, yes.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But you came anyway. I suppose I should be flattered.” She walked slowly around him, looking him up and down, from feet to forehead and back again. “You took your time, though. It’s late. I’ll have to be getting home soon.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was something about the way she was looking at him which was not helping to calm his thumping heart. Quite the opposite. He had to tell her that he could not see her any more. It was the wrong thing to do. For both of them. Nothing good could come from it… nothing good…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was breathing quick, tense, excited, unable to take his eyes away from her shadowy face. He had to tell her, now. Wasn’t that why he came? He opened his mouth to speak, but the arguments all seemed a long way away now, applying at a different time and to different people, intangible and weightless.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ardee…” he began.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Mmm?” She stepped towards him, head cocked on one side. Jezal tried to move away, but the statue was at his back. She came closer still, lips slightly parted, her eyes fixed on his mouth. What was so wrong in it, anyway?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Closer still, her face turned up towards his. He could smell her—his head was full of the scent of her. He could feel her warm breath on his cheek. What could be wrong with this?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Her fingertips were cold against his skin, brushing the side of his face, tracing the line of his jaw, curling through his hair and pulling his head down towards her. Her lips touched his cheek, soft and warm, then his chin, then his mouth. They sucked gently at his. She pressed herself up against him, her other hand slipped round his back. Her tongue lapped at his gums, at his teeth, at his tongue, and she made little sounds in her throat. So did he, perhaps—he really wasn’t sure. His whole body was tingling, hot and cold at once, his mind was in his mouth. It was as if he’d never kissed a girl before. What could be wrong with this? Her teeth nipped at his lips, almost painful, but not quite.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He opened his eyes: breathless, trembling, weak at the knees. She was looking up at him. He could see her eyes gleaming in the darkness, watching him carefully, studying him.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ardee…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“When can I see you again?” His throat was dry, his voice sounded hoarse. She looked down at the ground with a little smile. A cruel smile, as though she’d called his bluff and won a pile of money from him. He didn’t care. “When?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, I’ll let you know.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He had to kiss her again. Shit on the consequences. Fuck West. Damn it all. He bent down towards her, closed his eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No, no, no.” She pushed his mouth away from hers. “You should have come sooner.” She broke away from him and turned around, with the smile still on her lips, and walked slowly away. He watched her, silent, frozen, fascinated, his back against the cold stone base of the statue. He had never felt like this before. Not ever.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She glanced back, just once, as if to check that he was still watching. His chest constricted, almost painfully, just to see her look at him, then she rounded a corner and was gone.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He stood there for a moment, his eyes wide open, just breathing. Then a cold gust of wind blew through the square and the world pressed back in upon him. Fencing, the war, his friend West, his obligations. One kiss, that was all. One kiss, and his resolve had leaked away like piss from a broken chamber pot. He stared around, suddenly guilty, confused, and scared. What had he done here?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Shit,” he said.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_32"></div></div></body>

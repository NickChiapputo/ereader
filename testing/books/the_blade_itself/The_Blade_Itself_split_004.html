<div id="filepos16596" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Questions</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Why do I do this?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Inquisitor Glokta asked himself for the thousandth time as he limped down the corridor. The walls were rendered and whitewashed, though none too recently. There was a seedy feel to the place and a smell of damp. There were no windows, as the hallway was deep beneath the ground, and the lanterns cast slow flowing shadows into every corner.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Why would anyone want to do this?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta’s walking made a steady rhythm on the grimy tiles of the floor. First the confident click of his right heel, then the tap of his cane, then the endless sliding of his left foot, with the familiar stabbing pains in the ankle, knee, arse and back. Click, tap, pain. That was the rhythm of his walking.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The dirty monotony of the corridor was broken from time to time by a heavy door, bound and studded with pitted iron. On one occasion, Glokta thought he heard a muffled cry of pain from behind one. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I wonder what poor fool is being questioned in there? What crime they are guilty, or innocent of? What secrets are being picked at, what lies cut through, what treasons laid bare?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He didn’t wonder long though. He was interrupted by the steps.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">If Glokta had been given the opportunity to torture any one man, any one at all, he would surely have chosen the inventor of steps. When he was young and widely admired, before his misfortunes, he had never really noticed them. He had sprung down them two at a time and gone blithely on his way. No more. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">They’re everywhere. You really can’t change floors without them. And down is worse than up, that’s the thing people never realise. Going up, you usually don’t fall that far.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He knew this flight well. Sixteen steps, cut from smooth stone, a little worn toward the centre, slightly damp, like everything down here. There was no banister, nothing to cling to. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Sixteen enemies. A challenge indeed.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> It had taken Glokta a long time to develop the least painful method of descending stairs. He went sideways like a crab. Cane first, then left foot, then right, with more than the usual agony as his left leg took his weight, joined by a persistent stabbing in the neck. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Why should it hurt in my neck when I go down stairs? Does my neck take my weight? Does it?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Yet the pain could not be denied.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta paused four steps from the bottom. He had nearly beaten them. His hand was trembling on the handle of his cane, his left leg aching like fury. He tongued his gums where his front teeth used to be, took a deep breath and stepped forward. His ankle gave way with a horrifying wrench and he plunged into space, twisting, lurching, his mind a cauldron of horror and despair. He stumbled onto the next step like a drunkard, fingernails scratching at the smooth wall, giving a squeal of terror. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">You stupid, stupid bastard!</span></span><span class="calibre3"> His cane clattered to the floor, his clumsy feet wrestled with the stones and he found himself at the bottom, by some miracle still standing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And here it is. That horrible, beautiful, stretched out moment between stubbing your toe and feeling the hurt. How long do I have before the pain comes? How bad will it be when it does?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Gasping, slack-jawed at the foot of the steps, Glokta felt a tingling of anticipation. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Here it comes…</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The agony was unspeakable, a searing spasm up his left side from foot to jaw. He squeezed his watering eyes tight shut, clamped his right hand over his mouth so hard that the knuckles clicked. His remaining teeth grated against each other as he locked his jaws together, but a high-pitched, jagged moan still whistled from him. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Am I screaming or laughing? How do I tell the difference?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He breathed in heaving gasps, through his nose, snot bubbling out onto his hand, his twisted body shaking with the effort of staying upright.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The spasm passed. Glokta moved his limbs cautiously, one by one, testing the damage. His leg was on fire, his foot numb, his neck clicked with every movement, sending vicious little stings down his spine. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Pretty good, considering.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He bent down with an effort and snatched up his cane between two fingers, drew himself up once more, wiped the snot and tears on the back of his hand. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Truly a thrill. Did I enjoy it? For most people stairs are a mundane affair. For me, an adventure!</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He limped off down the corridor, giggling quietly to himself. He was still smiling ever so faintly when he reached his own door and shuffled inside.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A grubby white box with two doors facing each other. The ceiling was too low for comfort, the room too brightly lit by blazing lamps. Damp was creeping out of one corner and the plaster had erupted with flaking blisters, speckled with black mould. Someone had tried to scrub a long bloodstain from one wall, but hadn’t tried nearly hard enough.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Practical Frost was standing on the other side of the room, big arms folded across his big chest. He nodded to Glokta, with all the emotion of a stone, and Glokta nodded back. Between them stood a scarred, stained wooden table, bolted to the floor and flanked by two chairs. A naked fat man sat in one of them, hands tied tightly behind him and with a brown canvas bag over his head. His quick, muffled breathing was the only sound. It was cold down here, but he was sweating. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">As well he should be.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta limped over to the other chair, leaned his cane carefully against the edge of the table top and slowly, cautiously, painfully sat down. He stretched his neck to the left and right, then allowed his body to slump into a position approaching comfort. If Glokta had been given the opportunity to shake the hand of any one man, any one at all, he would surely have chosen the inventor of chairs. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">He has made my life almost bearable.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Frost stepped silently out of the corner and took hold of the loose top of the bag between meaty, pale finger and heavy, white thumb. Glokta nodded and the Practical ripped it off, leaving Salem Rews blinking in the harsh light.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A mean, piggy, ugly little face. You mean, ugly pig, Rews. You disgusting swine. You’re ready to confess right now, I’ll bet, ready to talk and talk without interruption, until we’re all sick of it.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> There was a big dark bruise across his cheek and another on his jaw above his double chin. As his watering eyes adjusted to the brightness he recognised Glokta sitting opposite him, and his face suddenly filled with hope. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A sadly, sadly misplaced hope.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Glokta, you have to help me!” he squealed, leaning forward as far as his bonds would allow, words bubbling out in a desperate, mumbling mess. “I’m falsely accused, you know it, I’m innocent! You’ve come to help me, yes? You’re my friend! You have influence here. We’re friends, friends! You could say something for me! I’m an innocent man, falsely accused! I’m—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta held up his hand for silence. He stared at Rews’ familiar face for a moment, as though he had never laid eyes on him before. Then he turned to Frost. “Am I supposed to know this man?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The albino said nothing. The bottom part of his face was hidden by his Practical’s mask, and the top half gave nothing away. He stared unblinking at the prisoner in the chair, pink eyes as dead as a corpse. He hadn’t blinked once since Glokta came into the room. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">How can he do that?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It’s me, Rews!” hissed the fat man, the pitch of his voice rising steadily towards panic. “Salem Rews, you know me, Glokta! I was with you in the war, before… you know… we’re friends! We—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta held up his hand again and sat back, tapping one of his few remaining teeth with a fingernail as though deep in thought. “Rews. The name is familiar. A merchant, a member of the Guild of Mercers. A rich man by all accounts. I remember now…” Glokta leaned forward, pausing for effect. “He was a traitor! He was taken by the Inquisition, his property confiscated. You see, he had conspired to avoid the King’s taxes.” Rews’ mouth was hanging open. “The King’s taxes!” screamed Glokta, smashing his hand down on the table. The fat man stared, wide eyed, and licked at a tooth. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Upper right side, second from the back.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But where are our manners?” asked Glokta of no one in particular. “We may or may not have known each other once, but I don’t think you and my assistant have been properly introduced. Practical Frost, say hello to this fat man.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was an open-handed blow, but powerful enough to knock Rews clean out of his seat. The chair rattled but was otherwise unaffected. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">How is that done? To knock him to the ground but leave the chair standing?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Rews sprawled gurgling across the floor, face flattened on the tiles.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He reminds me of a beached whale,” said Glokta absently. The albino grabbed Rews under the arm and hauled him up, flung him back into the chair. Blood seeped from a cut on his cheek, but his piggy eyes were hard now. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Blows make most men soften up, but some men harden. I never would have taken this one for a tough man, but life is full of surprises.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Rews spat blood onto the table top. “You’ve gone too far here, Glokta, oh yes! The Mercers are an honourable guild; we have influence! They won’t put up with this! I’m a known man! Even now my wife will be petitioning the King to hear my case!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ah, your wife.” Glokta smiled sadly. “Your wife is a very beautiful woman. Beautiful, and young. I fear, perhaps, a little too young for you. I fear she took the opportunity to be rid of you. I fear she came forward with your books. All the books.” Rews’ face paled.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We looked at those books,” Glokta indicated an imaginary pile of papers on his left, “we looked at the books in the treasury,” indicating another on his right. “Imagine our surprise when we could not make the numbers add up. And then there were the night-time visits by your employees to warehouses in the old quarter, the small unregistered boats, the payments to officials, the forged documentation. Must I go on?” asked Glokta, shaking his head in profound disapproval. The fat man swallowed and licked his lips.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Pen and ink were placed before the prisoner, and the paper of confession, filled out in detail in Frost’s beautiful, careful script, awaiting only the signature. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I’ll get him right here and now.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Confess, Rews,” Glokta whispered softly, “and put a painless end to this regrettable business. Confess and name your accomplices. We already know who they are. It will be easier on all of us. I don’t want to hurt you, believe me, it will give me no pleasure.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Nothing will.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Confess. Confess, and you will be spared. Exile in Angland is not so bad as they would have you believe. There is still pleasure to be had from life there, and the satisfaction of a day of honest work, in the service of your King. Confess!” Rews stared at the floor, licking at his tooth. Glokta sat back and sighed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Or not,” he said, “and I can come back with my instruments.” Frost moved forward, his massive shadow falling across the fat man’s face. “Body found floating by the docks,” Glokta breathed, “bloated by seawater and horribly mutilated… far… far beyond recognition.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">He’s ready to talk. He’s fat and ripe and ready to burst.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Were the injuries inflicted before or after death?” he asked the ceiling breezily. “Was the mysterious deceased a man or a woman even?” Glokta shrugged. “Who can say?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a sharp knock at the door. Rews’ face jerked up, filled with hope again. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Not now, damn it!</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Frost went to the door, opened it a crack. Something was said. The door shut, Frost leaned down to whisper in Glokta’s ear.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ith Theverar,” came the half-tongued mumble, by which Glokta understood that Severard was at the door.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Already?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta smiled and nodded, as if it was good news. Rews’ face fell a little. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">How could a man whose business has been concealment find it impossible to hide his emotions in this room?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> But Glokta knew how. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">It’s hard to stay calm when you’re terrified, helpless, alone, at the mercy of men with no mercy at all. Who could know that better than me?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He sighed, and using his most world-weary tone of voice asked, “Do you wish to confess?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No!” The defiance had returned to the prisoner’s piggy eyes now. He stared back, silent and watchful, and sucked. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Surprising. Very surprising. But then we’re just getting started.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Is that tooth bothering you, Rews?” There was nothing Glokta didn’t know about teeth. His own mouth had been worked on by the very best. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Or the very worst, depending on how you look at it.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “It seems that I must leave you now, but while I’m away, I’ll be thinking about that tooth. I’ll be considering very carefully what to do with it.” He took hold of his cane. “I want you to think about me, thinking about your tooth. And I also want you to think, very carefully, about signing your confession.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta got awkwardly to his feet, shaking out his aching leg. “I think you may respond well to a straightforward beating however, so I’m going to leave you in the company of Practical Frost for half an hour.” Rews’ mouth became a silent circle of surprise. The albino picked up the chair, fat man and all, and turned it slowly around. “He’s absolutely the best there is at this kind of thing.” Frost took out a pair of battered leather gloves and began to pull them carefully onto his big white hands, one finger at a time. “You always did like to have the very best of everything, eh, Rews?” Glokta made for the door.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Wait! Glokta!” wailed Rews over his shoulder. “Wait I—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Practical Frost clamped a gloved hand over the fat man’s mouth and held a finger to his mask. “Thhhhhhh,” he said. The door clicked shut.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Severard was leaning against the wall in the corridor, one foot propped on the plaster behind him, whistling tunelessly beneath his mask and running a hand through his long, lanky hair. As Glokta came through the door he straightened up and gave a little bow, and it was plain by his eyes that he was smiling. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">He’s always smiling.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Superior Kalyne wants to see you,” he said in his broad, common accent, “and I’m of the opinion that I never saw him angrier.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Severard, you poor thing, you must be terrified. Do you have the box?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I do.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And you took something out for Frost?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I did.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And something for your wife too, I hope?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh yes,” said Severard, his eyes smiling more than ever, “My wife will be well taken care of. If I ever get one.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good. I hasten to answer the call of the Superior. When I have been with him for five minutes, come in with the box.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Just barge into his office?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Barge in and stab him in the face for all I care.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’d consider that done, Inquisitor.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta nodded, turned away, then turned back. “Don’t really stab him, eh, Severard?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Practical smiled with his eyes and sheathed his vicious-looking knife. Glokta rolled his eyes up to the ceiling, then limped off, his cane tapping on the tiles, his leg throbbing. Click, tap, pain. That was the rhythm of his walking.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Superior’s office was a large and richly appointed room high up in the House of Questions, a room in which everything was too big and too fancy. A huge, intricate window dominated one wood-panelled wall, offering a view over the well-tended gardens in the courtyard below. An equally huge and ornate desk stood in the centre of a richly coloured carpet from somewhere warm and exotic. The head of a fierce animal from somewhere cold and exotic was mounted above a magnificent stone fireplace with a tiny, mean fire close to burning out inside.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Superior Kalyne himself made his office look small and drab. A vast, florid man in his late fifties, he had over-compensated for his thinning hair with magnificent white side whiskers. He was considered a daunting presence even within the Inquisition, but Glokta was past scaring, and they both knew it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a big, fancy chair behind the desk, but the Superior was pacing up and down while he screamed, his arms waving. Glokta was seated on something which, while doubtless expensive, had clearly been designed to make its occupant as uncomfortable as possible. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">It doesn’t bother me much, though. Uncomfortable is as good as I ever get.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He amused himself with the thought of Kalyne’s head mounted above the fireplace instead of that fierce animal’s, while the Superior ranted at him. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">He’s every bit like his fireplace, the big dolt. Looks impressive, but there’s not much going on underneath. I wonder how he’d respond to an interrogation? I’d start with those ridiculous side whiskers.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> But Glokta’s face was a mask of attention and respect.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well you’ve outdone yourself this time, Glokta, you mad cripple! When the Mercers find out about this they’ll have you flayed!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’ve tried flaying, it tickles.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Damn it, keep your mouth shut and smile. Where’s that whistling fool Severard? I’ll have him flayed when I get out of here.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh yes, that’s good, that’s very good, Glokta, look at me laugh! And evasion of the King’s taxes?” The Superior glowered down, whiskers bristling. “The King’s taxes?” he screamed, spraying Glokta with spit. “They’re all at it! The Mercers, the Spicers, all of them! Every damn fool with a boat!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But this was so open, Superior. It was an insult to us. I felt we had to—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You felt?” Kalyne was red-faced and vibrating with rage. “You were explicitly told to keep away from the Mercers, away from the Spicers, away from all the big guilds!” He strode up and down with ever greater speed. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">You’ll wear your carpet out at this rate. The big guilds will have to buy you a new one.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You felt, did you? Well he’ll have to go back! We’ll have to release him and you’ll have to feel your way to a grovelling apology! It’s a damn disgrace! You’ve made me look ridiculous! Where is he now?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I left him in the company of Practical Frost.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“With that mumbling animal?” The Superior tore at his hair in desperation. “Well that’s it then, isn’t it? He’ll be a ruin now! We can’t send him back in that condition! You’re finished here, Glokta! Finished! I’m going straight to the Arch Lector! Straight to the Arch Lector!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The huge door was kicked open and Severard sauntered in carrying a wooden box. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And not a moment too soon.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The Superior stared, speechless, open-mouthed with wrath, as Severard dropped it on the desk with a thump and a jingle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What the hell is the meaning of…” Severard pulled open the lid, and Kalyne saw the money. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">All that lovely money.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He stopped in mid-rant, mouth stuck forming the next sound. He looked surprised, then he looked puzzled, then he looked cautious. He pursed his lips and slowly sat down.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Thank you, Practical Severard,” said Glokta. “You may go.” The Superior was stroking thoughtfully at his side whiskers as Severard strolled out, his face returning gradually to its usual shade of pink. “Confiscated from Rews. The property of the Crown now, of course. I thought that I should give it to you, as my direct superior, so that you could pass it on to the Treasury.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Or buy a bigger desk, you leech.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta leaned forward, hands on his knees. “You could say, perhaps, that Rews went too far, that questions had been asked, that an example had to be made. We can’t be seen to do nothing, after all. It’ll make the big guilds nervous, keep them in line.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">It’ll make them nervous and you can screw more out of them.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Or you could always tell them that I’m a mad cripple, and blame me for it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Superior was starting to like it now, Glokta could tell. He was trying not to show it, but his whiskers were quivering at the sight of all that money. “Alright, Glokta. Alright. Very well.” He reached out and carefully shut the lid of the box. “But if you ever think of doing something like this again… talk to me first, would you? I don’t like surprises.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta struggled to his feet, limped towards the door. “Oh, and one more thing!” He turned stiffly back. Kalyne was staring at him severely from beneath his big, fancy brows. “When I go to see the Mercers, I’ll need to take Rews’ confession.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta smiled broadly, showing the yawning gap in his front teeth. “That shouldn’t be a problem, Superior.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Kalyne had been right. There was no way that Rews could have gone back in this condition. His lips were split and bloody, his sides covered in darkening bruises, his head lolled sideways, face swollen almost past recognition. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">In short, he looks like a man ready to confess.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I don’t imagine you enjoyed the last half hour, Rews, I don’t imagine you enjoyed it much at all. Perhaps it was the worst half hour of your life, I really couldn’t say. I’m thinking about what we have for you here, though, and the sad fact is… that’s about as good as it gets. That’s the high life.” Glokta leaned forward, his lace just inches from the bloody pulp of Rews’ nose. “Practical Frost’s a little girl compared to me,” he whispered. “He’s a kitten. Once I get started with you, Rews, you’ll be looking back on this with nostalgia. You’ll be begging me to give you half an hour with the Practical. Do you understand?” Rews was silent, except for the air whistling through his broken nose.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Show him the instruments,” whispered Glokta.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Frost stepped forward and opened the polished case with a theatrical flourish. It was a masterful piece of craftsmanship. As the lid was pulled back, the many trays inside lifted and fanned out, displaying Glokta’s tools in all their gruesome glory. There were blades of every size and shape, needles curved and straight, bottles of oil and acid, nails and screws, clamps and pliers, saws, hammers, chisels. Metal, wood and glass glittered in the bright lamplight, all polished to mirror brightness and honed to a murderous sharpness. A big purple swelling under Rews’ left eye had closed it completely, but the other darted over the instruments: terrified, fascinated. The functions of some were horribly obvious, the functions of others were horribly obscure. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Which scare him more, I wonder?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We were talking about your tooth, I think,” murmured Glokta. Rews’ eye flicked up to look at him. “Or would you like to confess?” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I have him, here he comes. Confess, confess, confess, confess…</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a sharp knock at the door. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Damn it again!</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Frost opened it a crack and there was a brief whispering. Rews licked at his bloated lip. The door shut, the albino leaned to whisper in Glokta’s ear.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ith the Arth Ector.” Glokta froze. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The money was not enough. While I was shuffling back from Kalyne’s office, the old bastard was reporting me to the Arch Lector. Am I finished then?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He felt a guilty thrill at the thought. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Well, I’ll see to this fat pig first.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Tell Severard I’m on my way.” Glokta turned back to talk to his prisoner, but Frost put a big white hand on his shoulder.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“O. The Arth Ector,” Frost pointed to the door, “he’th ere. Ow.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Here?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta could feel his eyelid twitching. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Why?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He pushed himself up using the edge of the table. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Will they find me in the canal tomorrow? Dead and bloated, far… far beyond recognition?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The only emotion that he felt at the idea was a flutter of mild relief. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">No more stairs.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector of His Majesty’s Inquisition was standing outside in the corridor. The grimy walls looked almost brown behind him, so brilliantly spotless were his long white coat, his white gloves, his shock of white hair. He was past sixty, but showed none of the infirmity of age. Every tall, clean-shaven, fine-boned inch of him was immaculately turned out. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">He looks like a man who has never once in his life been surprised by anything.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They had met once before, six years earlier when Glokta joined the Inquisition, and he hardly seemed to have changed. Arch Lector Sult. One of the most powerful men in the Union. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">One of the most powerful men in the world, come to that.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Behind him, almost like outsized shadows, loomed two enormous, silent, black-masked Practicals.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector gave a thin smile when he saw Glokta shuffle out of his door. It said a lot, that smile. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Mild scorn, mild pity, the very slightest touch of menace. Anything but amusement.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Inquisitor Glokta,” he said, holding out one white-gloved hand, palm down. A ring with a huge purple stone flashed on his finger.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I serve and obey, your Eminence.” Glokta could not help grimacing as he bent slowly forward to touch his lips to the ring. A difficult and painful manoeuvre, it seemed to take forever. When he finally hoisted himself back upright, Sult was gazing at him calmly with his cool blue eyes. A look that implied he already understood Glokta completely, and was unimpressed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Come with me.” The Arch Lector turned and swept away down the corridor. Glokta limped along after him, the silent Practicals marching close behind. Sult moved with an effortless, languid confidence, coat tails flapping gracefully out behind him. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Bastard.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Soon they reached a door, much like his own. The Arch Lector unlocked it and went inside, the Practicals took up positions either side of the doorway, arms folded. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A private interview then. One which I, perhaps, will never leave.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta stepped over the threshold.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">A box of grubby white plaster too brightly lit and with a ceiling too low for comfort. It had a big crack instead of a damp patch, but was otherwise identical to his own room. It had the scarred table, the cheap chairs, it even had a poorly cleaned bloodstain. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I wonder if they’re painted on, for the effect?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> One of the Practicals suddenly pulled the door shut with a loud bang. Glokta was intended to jump, but he couldn’t be bothered.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Arch Lector Sult lowered himself gracefully into one of the seats, drew a heavy sheaf of yellowing papers across the table towards him. He waved his hand at the other chair, the one that would be used by the prisoner. The implications were not lost on Glokta.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I prefer to stand, your Eminence.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sult smiled at him. He had lovely, pointy teeth, all shiny white. “No, you don’t.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">He has me there.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta lowered himself ungracefully into the prisoner’s chair while the Arch Lector turned over the first page of his wedge of documents, frowned and shook his head gently as though horribly disappointed by what he saw. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The details of my illustrious career, perhaps?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I had a visit from Superior Kalyne not long ago. He was most upset.” Sult’s hard blue eyes came up from his papers. “Upset with you, Glokta. He was quite vocal on the subject. He told me that you are an uncontrollable menace, that you act without a thought for the consequences, that you are a mad cripple. He demanded that you be removed from his department.” The Arch Lector smiled, a cold, nasty smile, the kind Glokta used on his prisoners. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But with more teeth.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “I think he had it in mind that you be removed… altogether.” They stared at each other across the table.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Is this where I beg for mercy? Is this where I crawl on the ground and kiss your feet? Well, I don’t care enough to beg and I’m far too stiff to crawl. Your Practicals will have to kill me sitting down. Cut my throat. Bash my head in. Whatever. As long as they get on with it.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But Sult was in no rush. The white-gloved hands moved neatly, precisely, the pages hissed and crackled. “We have few men like you in the Inquisition, Glokta. A nobleman, from an excellent family. A champion swordsman, a dashing cavalry officer. A man once groomed for the very top.” Sult looked him up and down as though he could hardly believe it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That was before the war, Arch Lector.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Obviously. There was much dismay at your capture, and little hope that you would be returned alive. As the war dragged on and the months passed, hope diminished to nothing, but when the treaty was signed, you were among those prisoners returned to the Union.” He peered at Glokta through narrowed eyes. “Did you talk?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta couldn’t help himself, he spluttered with shrill laughter. It echoed strangely in the cold room. Not a sound you often heard down here. “Did I talk? I talked until my throat was raw. I told them everything I could think of. I screamed every secret I’d ever heard. I babbled like a fool. When I ran out of things to tell them I made things up. I pissed myself and cried like a girl. Everyone does.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But not everyone survives. Two years in the Emperor’s prisons. No one else lasted half that long. The physicians were sure you would never leave your bed again, but a year later you made your application to the Inquisition.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">We both know it. We were both there. What do you want from me, and why not get on with it? I suppose some men just love the sound of their own voices.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I was told that you were crippled, that you were broken, that you could never be mended, that you could never be trusted. But I was inclined to give you a chance. Some fool wins the Contest every year, and wars produce many promising soldiers, but your achievement in surviving those two years was unique. So you were sent to the North, and put in charge of one of our mines there. What did you make of Angland?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A filthy sink of violence and corruption. A prison where we have made slaves of the innocent and guilty alike in the name of freedom. A stinking hole where we send those we hate and those we are ashamed of to die of hunger, and disease, and hard labour.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “It was cold,” said Glokta.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And so were you. You made few friends in Angland. Precious few among the Inquisition, and none among the exiles.” He plucked a tattered letter from among the papers and cast a critical eye over it. “Superior Goyle told me that you were a cold fish, had no blood in you at all. He thought you’d never amount to anything, that he could make no use of you.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Goyle. That bastard. That butcher. I’d rather have no blood than no brains.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But after three years, production was up. It was doubled in fact. So you were brought back to Adua, to work under Superior Kalyne. I thought perhaps you would learn discipline with him, but it seems I was wrong. You insist on going your own way.” The Arch Lector frowned up at him. “To be frank, I think that Kalyne is afraid of you. I think they all are. They don’t like your arrogance, they don’t like your methods, they don’t like your… special insight into our work.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And what do you think, Arch Lector?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Honestly? I’m not sure I like your methods much either, and I doubt that your arrogance is entirely deserved. But I like your results. I like your results very much.” He slapped the bundle of papers closed and rested one hand on top of it, leaning across the table towards Glokta. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">As I might lean towards my prisoners when I ask them to confess.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “I have a task for you. A task that should make better use of your talents than chasing around after petty smugglers. A task that may allow you to redeem yourself in the eyes of the Inquisition.” The Arch Lector paused for a long moment. “I want you to arrest Sepp dan Teufel.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta frowned. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Teufel?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “The Master of the Mints, your Eminence?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The very same.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The Master of the Royal Mints. An important man from an important family. A very big fish, to be hooked in my little tank. A fish with powerful friends. It could be dangerous, arresting a man like that. It could be fatal.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “May I ask why?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You may not. Let me worry about the whys. You concentrate on obtaining a confession.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A confession to what, Arch Lector?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Why, to corruption and high treason! It seems our friend the Master of the Mints has been most indiscreet in some of his personal dealings. It seems he has been taking bribes, conspiring with the Guild of Mercers to defraud the King. As such, it would be very useful if a ranking Mercer were to name him, in some unfortunate connection.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">It can hardly be a coincidence that I have a ranking Mercer in my interrogation room, even as we speak.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta shrugged. “Once people start talking, it’s shocking the names that tumble out.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good.” The Arch Lector waved his hand. “You may go, Inquisitor. I will come for Teufel’s confession this time tomorrow. You had better have it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta breathed slowly as he laboured back along the corridor.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Breath in, breath out. Calm.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He had not expected to leave that room alive. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And now I find myself moving in powerful circles. A personal task for the Arch Lector, squeezing a confession to high treason from one of the Unions most trusted officials. The most powerful of circles, but for how long? Why me? Because of my results? Or because I won’t be missed?</span></span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I apologise for all the interruptions today, really I do, it’s like a brothel in here with all the coming and going.” Rews twisted his cracked and swollen lips into a sad smile. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Smiling at a time like this, he’s a marvel. But all things must end.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Let us be honest, Rews. No one is coming to help you. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. You will confess. The only choices you have are when, and the state you’ll be in when you do. There’s really nothing to be gained by putting it off. Except pain. We’ve got lots of that for you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was hard to read the expression on Rews’ bloody face, but his shoulders sagged. He dipped the pen in the ink with a trembling hand, wrote his name, slightly slanted, across the bottom of the paper of confession. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I win again. Does my leg hurt any less? Do I have my teeth back? Has it helped me to destroy this man, who I once called a friend? Then why do I do this?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The scratching of the nib on the paper was the only reply.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Excellent,” said Glokta. Practical Frost turned the document over. “And this is the list of your accomplices?” He let his eye scan lazily over the names. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A handful of junior Mercers, three ship’s captains, an officer of the city watch, a pair of minor customs officials. A tedious recipe indeed. Let us see if we can add some spice.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta turned it around and pushed it back across the table. “Add Sepp dan Teufel’s name to the list, Rews.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The fat man looked confused. “The Master of the Mints?” he mumbled, through his thick lips.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“That’s the one.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But I never met the man.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So?” snapped Glokta. “Do as I tell you.” Rews paused, mouth a little open. “Write, you fat pig.” Practical Frost cracked his knuckles.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Rews licked his lips. “Sepp… dan… Teufel,” he mumbled to himself as he wrote.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Excellent.” Glokta carefully shut the lid on his horrible, beautiful instruments. “I’m glad for both our sakes that we won’t be needing these today.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Frost snapped the manacles shut on the prisoner’s wrists and dragged him to his feet, started to march him toward the door at the back of the room. “What now?” shouted Rews over his shoulder.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Angland, Rews, Angland. Don’t forget to pack something warm.” The door cracked shut behind him. Glokta looked at the list of names in his hands. Sepp dan Teufel’s sat at the bottom. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">One name. On the face of it, just like the others. Teufel. Just one more name. But such a perilous one.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Severard was waiting outside in the corridor, smiling as always. “Shall I put the fat man in the canal?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No, Severard. Put him in the next boat to Angland.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re in a merciful mood today, Inquisitor.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta snorted. “Mercy would be the canal. That swine won’t last six weeks in the North. Forget him. We have to arrest Sepp dan Teufel tonight.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Severard’s eyebrows rose. “Not the Master of the Mints?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“None other. On the express orders of his Eminence the Arch Lector. It seems he’s been taking money from the Mercers.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, for shame.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We’ll leave as soon as it gets dark. Tell Frost to be ready.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The thin Practical nodded, his long hair swaying. Glokta turned and hobbled up the corridor, cane tapping on the grimy tiles, left leg burning.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Why do I do this?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He asked himself again.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Why do I do this?</span></span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_4"></div></div></body>

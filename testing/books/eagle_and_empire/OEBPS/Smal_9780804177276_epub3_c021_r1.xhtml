<p class="para-pf-alt" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">“S</span>o we shall not rule the air after all,” Decinius Sabinus said moodily. “Do the gods curse us?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hush,” said Marcellinus, although the only other person within earshot was Enopay. “Treasonous talk is punishable by death.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sabinus stared at him as if he had lost his mind. “I meant that as wry humor,” Marcellinus said quickly. “Gods’ sakes, Quintus…I withdraw it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Humor poorly placed, sir.” Shaking his head, Sabinus walked to the door of his Praetorium tent and frowned out over the camp.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was dawn the next day, and Sabinus had been so critically busy the previous evening that he was only now hearing about the Feathered Serpents for the first time.</p>
<p class="para-p">“We know nothing yet,” Enopay said. “Pretty snakes in the air? Can they carry anything beyond four archers apiece? Probably not. Our Thunderbirds can rain fire. Those Serpents sound awkward and ungainly; a single mistake by any pilot pulls them all aside. Our Thunderbirds are elegant. So their horses can pull their Firebirds into the sky? Surely our towers can throw our Hawks higher and faster.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus studied Sabinus’s face and half wished that Enopay had not accompanied him. “Quintus, we knew before now that we faced a formidable coalition. The Serpents change nothing.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page338" title="338"/>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, you’re right, of course.” Decinius Sabinus’s face told a different story.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Enopay, a moment?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Leave us, please.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The boy looked hurt, and for an absurd moment Marcellinus thought he might refuse. He gestured in hand-talk: <em class="char-i">Please. Sorry. Go.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, Praetor.” Enopay saluted Roman-style and walked down the steps into the mud of Forward Camp.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus joined Sabinus in the doorway. “Come, man. Chin up. We can win this.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Can we?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes. We can.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sabinus sighed. “My men are tired and unsettled, Gaius. The Third has been in country for four years now. <em class="char-i">Four bloody years</em>, and even if we pulled up stakes today, it would be next year before we made landfall in Europa. This is the single longest campaign of my life. And my legionaries, so far from home: no family, no women, poor food, and little roistering. Not even a damned baths worthy of the name. And for all that, no battle glory or plunder to make the game worth the candle.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We’re about to change all that,” Marcellinus said. “Starting today.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Are we? We have three legions, plus Cahokia, the Iroqua, the Hand. The Mongols have four tumens, plus the Tlingit, the Sunners, and probably your damned Shappans again, too. And they have Jin salt in bombs more effective than the Greek fire of Cahokia.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And we have Roman discipline and precision against an army of nomads.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sabinus broke away and paced, casting an eye across the castra to where his tribunes were marshaling the cohorts of the Third Parthica. “I know you’re trying to buck me up, Gaius, and I appreciate it. But the Mongols are far from simple nomads now. They’re strong. Versatile. Ruthlessly well organized. They’re a modern army, and you know that as well as I.” He shook his head. “This war may very well be the death of me, Gaius. It may well, indeed. I’m quite serious.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had only a few moments before Sabinus would have to go speak with his tribunes, his primus pilus, his quartermaster. A legion’s first set-piece action in a new war always required close attention from its Praetor. And Marcellinus himself had to talk with Appius Gallus and Tahtay, because once the Third Parthica cleared the gates, the Sixth and the Hesperian cohorts would deploy next. “Quintus Decinius Sabinus, I know this land, and I also know the power of Roma and the strength of Cahokia and its Hesperian allies. I’ve seen the armies of Chinggis and Chagatai from the air, and they’re certainly impressive. It’s disheartening that they also have large wings as well as small. But Roma has stood for nearly two thousand years and has faced far sterner adversaries than this. So the Mongols are fierce and merciless. What of it?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page339" title="339"/>
<p class="para-p">Sabinus did not look at him, but Marcellinus knew he was listening.</p>
<p class="para-p">He wanted to say: <em class="char-i">Quintus, more than once I have been a broken man, but today I am not. And that is all Cahokia’s doing. Breathe in their strength and stand strong yourself.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">Instead, he said: “I swear to you, sir, on my honor both as a Praetor of Roma and as a prominent figure in the Hesperian League, that together we can beat the living shit out of those bastards.”</p>
<p class="para-p">At last Decinius Sabinus smiled. “Yes? You say so?” he said in Cahokian. “Then say it to my eyes.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Amused at his use of the native tongue, Marcellinus held the man’s gaze without blinking. Also in Cahokian he said: “Yes, mighty chief. We will destroy the Mongols. We will scalp their warriors and make their women and children weep. And then we will dance and feast. I have spoken.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sabinus drew himself up and switched back to Latin. “Very well, Gaius Marcellinus. Though if it’s all the same, I’ll leave the dancing to you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Send the Mongols to Hades, Decinius Sabinus.” Marcellinus saluted.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sabinus saluted back and set off toward his tribunes.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The two Mongol camps were a mere eight miles from Forward Camp and were separated from each other by about the same distance. As Chinggis and Chagatai showed no signs of combining their forces, this day’s action would take place on two fronts.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page340" title="340"/>
<p class="para-p">Skirmishers from both sides had been out since well before dawn. Mongol horsemen had probed across the Plains toward Forward Camp. Squadrons of light cavalry from the Ala II Hispanorum Aravacorum had darted out in the opposite direction, sometimes colliding with the Mongols in brief and inconclusive clashes. Mahkah and his fleetest riders of the Second Cahokian had lunged forward to within a half mile of Chinggis’s camp before being chased back by Firebirds and arrow fire, as close to counting coup as they were likely to get before the true battle began.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now, Legio III Parthica advanced across the grass toward the army of Chinggis Khan in a broad line of cohorts, flanked by alae of light cavalry. The cavalry of the Ala I Gallorum et Pannoniorum Cataphractaria followed, wearing their scale armor and bearing their heavy contus lances. Sabinus was leading with his First Cohort and the other odd-numbered cohorts, keeping the evens in reserve. Legionaries tired quickly in battles against a mostly mounted army, and choosing the right moment to relieve the front lines with fresh troops was key.</p>
<p class="para-p">Somewhere across the Wemissori River to the north were several cohorts of the Legio XXVII Augusta Martia Victrix, along with the Alae III and IV Polovtsia. For now they would guard the army’s wider flanks; unless the Mongols executed an enveloping action, the 27th and the western steppe auxiliaries would not fight today. The Chernye had seen action the previous day, of course, holding off the outriders of the Khan so that Marcellinus and the others could escape, and the Polovtsians had also been in the field, pushing back Mongol skirmishers and scouts. In exchange, so as not to leave the fighting legions short of cavalry, the Second Aravacorum would control the area between the Third and Sixth Legions, safeguarding the flanks of each and preventing an enterprising Mongol strike force from moving between them.</p>
<p class="para-p">By midmorning Praetor Gaius Marcellinus was leading the Sixth Ferrata from the camp, heading for the other Mongol army, that of Chagatai. Flanking the Sixth were his Cahokian cavalry: the Second Cahokian of Mahkah on his left wing and the Third Cahokian of Hanska on his right. To his left rear Tahtay led a combined force consisting of the First Cahokian and the so-called Hesperian Auxiliary of Wahchintonka, which was to say the Wolf Warriors and a heterogeneous group of Iroqua and Blackfoot. As Marcellinus rode across the Plains, he had to stifle the nervous tic of looking back over his shoulder. Ideally he would have wanted the First Cahokian with him, but in his first action leading the Sixth Ferrata he needed to stand firm with his legion.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page341" title="341"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus knew he should have been proud to lead the Ironclads into battle. Sabinus’s Legio III Parthica had been formed by Septimius Severus more than a thousand years earlier. The Legio VI Ferrata had an even more ancient pedigree. It had its roots in the Sixth Legion that Julius Caesar had taken to Egypt. Disbanded for a year and then rededicated in 44 B.C., it had been commanded by Marcus Antonius in Judea and in his Parthian War. (Ironically for Marcellinus, a century later it had been put under the charge of one Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, a distant ancestor of the Corbulo who had mutinied against him outside Cahokia.) The Sixth Ironclads had continued to earn a sterling reputation over the ensuing centuries. It was only over the last hundred years that some of their luster had tarnished, and their seaborne thrashing at the hands of the Mongols in the Mare Solis was one of their worst defeats ever. Marcellinus was determined to return the legion to some of its former glory, and to acquit himself well in the coming battle, both for his sake and for theirs. Yet despite the prestige of leading the Sixth Ferrata, a large part of his soul wished that he was riding with Tahtay at the head of the First Cahokian instead.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had the winding ribbon of the Wemissori River to his right, several hundred yards beyond Hanska’s cavalry. On the Wemissori’s far bank the Fifth Cohort of Agrippa’s 27th Legion marched in a triple line. Far beyond, the right flank of the Fifth would be covered by the Cohors IV Gallorum Equitata, the Fourth Gallorum, roaming far and wide to check for Mongol strike forces.</p>
<p class="para-p">A quarter mile behind the Sixth Ferrata came Marcellinus’s corps of engineers and members of the Raven clan, protected by his horsemen of his Cohors Equitata IX Thracum Syriaca, the Ninth Syrian. On fifteen heavy Cahokian wagons the engineers carried three Sky Lanterns and the ramps, portable furnace, fuel, and bellows to launch them, plus the stripped down components for five throwing engines. The throwing engines were to relaunch any Cahokian Hawk or Eagle that landed behind the battle line. The aerial craft would initially launch from the towers; several of them were being moved out from Forward Camp, but much more slowly, and would remain far to the rear of the armies. They had brought none of the more conventional ballistae and onagers, which would not be effective against horse troops.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page342" title="342"/>
<p class="para-p">From his current position, riding a hundred feet in front of the Sixth, Marcellinus saw the two Norsemen, Isleifur Bjarnason and—what was his name, Einar Steensen? Steffensen?—standing dismounted next to a standard they had thrust into the ground. To the best of their reckoning this was the midway point: the flag marked a spot four miles distant from Forward Camp and an equal distance from the camp of Chagatai. Here the Roman and Cahokian forces would stop and await battle.</p>
<p class="para-p">They stood on a wide prairie with low, gently rolling hills. A stream lay to their rear, and the Wemissori to the north. If they advanced beyond this point, the Mongols would gain the advantage; the Romans would be too far away from their launchers and too extended to fall back to their camp quickly at need. They would go no farther. If the Mongols did not meet them here in battle, the Sixth would withdraw that afternoon.</p>
<p class="para-p">One thing was sure: the Mongols were not near yet or Bjarnason and Steensen or Steffensen would be mounted and racing back across the grass toward him.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Good enough,” he said to Dizala. “We halt here.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Aye.” Dizala gestured to his trumpeter to spread the order down the line of the legion and beyond it to the cavalry. Piece by piece, the Sixth came to a halt. The adjutants came forward to be in position for any further orders.</p>
<p class="para-p">Harking to the trumpet, Bjarnason got on his horse and rode back to Marcellinus’s position. “Well, fancy meeting you lot here. Out for a stroll, are we?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page343" title="343"/>
<p class="para-p">“Report,” Marcellinus said tersely, in no mood for banter.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, the bastards are on the move. They’re just taking their sweet time about it. Are you all right?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of course.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus would have appreciated a little more formality and military discipline. Perhaps he would get it from the other one. He peered out at the forward scout. “What the hell is his name, again?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Who, Einar Stenberg?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes. Thank you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“He’s a straight arrow. Trustworthy.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m sure he is. How far are the Mongols?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Two miles, maybe.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Maybe? Go forward and make a better estimate.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Bjarnason flinched at Marcellinus’s tone. He saluted and trotted away.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus fell silent. There was little else to do at the moment. The centurions had ordered their men to stand easy. Some were obsessively checking and rechecking weapons and kit; others were sipping water, gnawing on deer jerky or hazelnut cakes, or looking at the skies and discussing the weather. Some were even sitting down to play knucklebones.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Shit,” said Marcellinus.</p>
<p class="para-p">“They’ll be fine,” Appius Gallus said, sensing criticism. “A little break in the tension is good for ’em. A breather after the march. Little rituals will settle ’em down. They’ll be up on their toes again as soon as you say the word.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded curtly. He didn’t doubt it. Hurry up and wait had been central to the military experience since Roma was nothing more than a scrappy village squabbling with the villages on the next hills.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was his own nerves he was worried about. It was almost a decade since Marcellinus had led legionaries in battle. But he chose not to mention that.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page344" title="344"/>
<p class="para-p">The first Sky Lantern drifted skyward and was soon at its operating height of a thousand feet. The wind was from south of east, meaning the Lantern eased forward and seemed to lean in over the waiting legion. Marcellinus saw Chogan tossing fuel into the fire jar, while Romans with wide colored paddles signaled to their colleagues on the ground. Past the Sky Lantern and much higher, a Catanwakuwa sailed on the breeze.</p>
<p class="para-p">The wind favored Roma. Was that enough to make the Mongols decline battle for the day?</p>
<p class="para-p">He heard a familiar <em class="char-i">whomph</em> sound, but from quite a distance. Far away a black powder bomb had gone off, its smoke drifting lazily into the air.</p>
<p class="para-p">He glanced up at the Sky Lantern just in time to see Chogan’s signal. Five miles away, battle had been joined between the forces of Decinius Sabinus and those of Chinggis Khan.</p>
<p class="para-p">The war for Nova Hesperia had begun while Marcellinus, the Sixth, and his Cahokian cohorts sat…and waited.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Shit,” he said again.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“Eyes up,” Aurelius Dizala said. “Here we go.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Norse scout Stenberg was cantering back toward them, his gladius raised above his head. A few hundred yards behind him a long, dark line was emerging.</p>
<p class="para-p">“About fucking time,” Marcellinus said, and his adjutants laughed dutifully, Enopay’s laugh pitched a little higher than the others. About to give the order to rouse the legion for action, Marcellinus saw it was unnecessary. All up and down the line of the Sixth Ironclads, centurions were bringing the men to their feet, mustering them for inspection. Marcellinus trusted that Mahkah and Hanska would be similarly bringing their horsemen to order and preparing for the onslaught.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols were coming. They would fight today after all.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus felt a brief moment of dislocation. In battle with the Iroqua on Cahokian soil, he had fought with Mahkah and Hanska by his side, and Takoda, too. Now Mahkah and Hanska would command light Cahokian cavalry in the service of the Imperator, miles away from Marcellinus, and Takoda stood by with his other five adjutants, waiting to help with logistics.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page345" title="345"/>
<p class="para-p">Even farther away, Tahtay was standing at the head of the First Cahokian, ready to lead them into gods knew what.</p>
<p class="para-p">Meanwhile, Marcellinus was surrounded by the cohorts of Roma. He would spend the coming hours commanding and fighting alongside men he’d known for less than a year.</p>
<p class="para-p">For his first foray back into Roman military command, Marcellinus had chosen a standard triplex acies line. From left to right on the front line were the Fourth, Third, Second, and First Cohorts, with broad gaps left between them, putting the double-strength First Cohort under Appius Gallus in the front right position. Behind them the second line consisted of the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Cohorts, offset to form a checkered pattern. The third line consisted of the Tenth, Ninth, and Eighth. This wrapped line was essential to keep the cohorts together with the tribunes who led them. Without that, Statius Paulinus’s cohorts would have been at opposite sides of the legionary formation.</p>
<p class="para-p">The intervals between the front cohorts were key to the success of the formation. The gaps allowed more flexibility in advancing, permitted the cohorts in the second line to move forward and support or relieve the first, and provided channels down which his light infantry or cavalry could sally out into the fray. Any enemy foot soldiers or cavalry who ventured into the intervals would come under attack from three sides.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was into one of those gaps in the formation that Einar Stenberg now rode, with Bjarnason not far behind. For the rest of the battle they would serve as couriers.</p>
<p class="para-p">The chessboard arrangement of Marcellinus’s cohorts was repeated within his individual units. The Mongols invariably opened offensives with an arrow cloud from their light cavalry, which was armed with their infamous composite bows. The Sixth would present a united front, returning fire with bows while defending themselves behind a wall of scuta. Once the missiles gave way to the shock attack of a full Mongol cavalry charge, the cohorts would have the flexibility and maneuverability necessary to deal with that, too.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page346" title="346"/>
<p class="para-p">After that, anything could happen.</p>
<p class="para-p">The dark line before them was now recognizable as a broad swath of horsemen. “Well, then,” said Praetor Gaius Marcellinus. “Better get to it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Dizala nodded. “Good luck, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And to you, and may the gods smile on us.” Marcellinus knew no gods, but other men did, and it was what a general was supposed to say at such moments.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus studied his front line and nodded in satisfaction, making the gesture broad enough to be seen at a distance. He considered prebattle speeches an exercise in self-indulgence; anything he said would be inaudible beyond fifty feet away, and Romans did not have hand-talkers to spread the words onward as Hesperians did. Let each centurion fire up his men in his own way, undisturbed. Nonetheless the nearby centurions ordered pila raised in salute, and some of the men even gave Marcellinus a mild cheer. Marcellinus raised his fist in a return salute.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus threaded his way through to the rear of his army. During the action he was supposed to remain behind the First Cohort with his band of adjutants, signalmen, and scouts. From there he would direct the legion to the best of his abilities and could be found by dispatch riders from the Imperator if they needed him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Beyond the rear of the Sixth Ironclads he saw a line of several dozen carts bearing water, ready to replenish men and horses as necessary during the long afternoon. Behind them were the Sky Lantern ramps and throwing engines. Wearing his white-plumed Praetor’s helmet and sitting astride his great gray Thessalian steed with its scale armor barding, Marcellinus was a very recognizable figure, and as he rode out, the leader of each crew raised his gladius high, the signal that his ramps or engines were ready for action. Behind would be the first in the long line of signalmen who would relay information back to Forward Camp and the crews that were launching Hawks and Thunderbirds.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page347" title="347"/>
<p class="para-p">All was as ready as it could be. In the meantime, the advancing Mongols had halved the separation between themselves and his front line. In mere minutes they would launch their attack…</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus blinked and looked again, and a murmur rippled through his cohorts. What he had initially taken for an unbroken line of cavalry was no such thing. Ahead of the cavalry marched a squad of, what, infantry? Did the Mongols plan to use their fire lances right off the bat?</p>
<p class="para-p">He hoped so. A thrown pilum had a much greater range than a fire lance. No matter how well armored, its Mongol wielder would quickly be killed or at least knocked back. The smart time to use the fire lances was not against fresh troops but later in the battle, once the cohorts were disordered and weary.</p>
<p class="para-p">No. The first line had a solid core of marching infantry at its center, Hesperian in all likelihood, preceded by a wide line of other foot soldiers—</p>
<p class="para-p">“Damn Chagatai to hell,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Right now, he should dismount and allow his horse to be moved back by his adjutants. His helmet and extra height made him a ridiculously easy target. But he could not yet dispense with the mobility the Thessalian provided. Spurring it on, Marcellinus galloped back to the front line. After a moment of consternation his adjutants and trumpeter hurried after him.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols were driving prisoners before them. The men were not infantry but Hesperian captives. By their tattoos, scarifications and paint, clothing, and hair Marcellinus recognized Blackfoot, Hidatsa, Cherokee, and what could only be Shoshoni. Brutally forcing them forward were other Hesperians, allies of the Mongol Khan: a few Tlingit and Haida, but by far the most plentiful were…the Shappa Ta’atani.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus cursed again. This was going to make for one hell of a complicated battlefield.</p>
<p class="para-p">He turned and snapped a series of instructions to his trumpeter, who looked perplexed. Marcellinus didn’t blame him. He had no idea whether there were clear cornu signals for the orders he had just given. He pointed to his Cahokian adjutants and gave them another set of orders. The adjutants ran.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page348" title="348"/>
<p class="para-p">Another thought struck him. He turned again to his unfortunate cornicen. “Lanceae, not pila, for the Shappans. You hear? Lanceae! Lanceae!”</p>
<p class="para-p">The line of Hesperian prisoners was just three hundred feet away. The front ranks of Marcellinus’s legion had figured it out; his legionaries were swaying left and right on the balls of their feet as soldiers did when they were exchanging words, talking grimly to one another.</p>
<p class="para-p">For most of their time in Nova Hesperia the legionaries had lived in tents, barracks, and galleys. To most of them, all natives looked alike. And even if they didn’t, their centurions might even now be deciding that the prisoners were already casualties of war and should be dispatched as quickly as possible to get at the real enemies behind them.</p>
<p class="para-p">And once upon a time, Marcellinus would have made that same ruthless decision.</p>
<p class="para-p">At last, his trumpeter gave the commands. The cornu blared a complicated sequence of notes, quickly taken up by the lead trumpeters for each cohort and spread to the far corners of the Sixth. Centurions looked right and left, irritated. Some shook their heads.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Cahokian adjutants stepped forward now: Takoda, Napayshni, and Enopay, one at the front of each of the First, Second, and Third Cohorts. Marcellinus hated bringing Enopay to the battlefield, hated it more than anything he had yet done, but he had little choice. For all intents and purposes Enopay had to be considered a man now, even if he didn’t look like one.</p>
<p class="para-p">His three adjutants began to hand-talk in giant, emphasized motions, each saying the same thing.</p>
<p class="para-p">More trumpet calls, and the cohorts walked forward to meet the attack. This, at least, was normal tactics. Advancing troops were more confident than troops at rest. Stepping up to meet your opponent was always preferable to standing waiting for him. Against enemies on foot a running charge was often best, but it used precious energy. Striding with determination was almost as good.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page349" title="349"/>
<p class="para-p">But now, following Marcellinus’s order, the front line of his legion began to open. Shields that had overlapped to form a wall parted as the men behind them came into open order—grudgingly in many cases.</p>
<p class="para-p">Arrows began to fly. The Mongol horse archers were now within bow range and were loosing arrows at a forty-five-degree angle to shower down upon the front rows of Roman troops. Marcellinus’s soldiers hastily raised their scuta.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Hesperian prisoners were running now, straight for the Roman front line, forced on by the Shappans and the Mongol horsemen.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols were almost within spear range. The front rank of the Sixth Ferrata stepped forward to hurl their weapons. With relief Marcellinus saw that his message had gotten through: Aurelius Dizala had given the order to cast the legion’s lighter throwing javelins rather than the heavy pila. First, the lanceae had a longer range and would cause damage sooner in the Shappan ranks before they closed for a melee. Second, it saved the heavy pila for battle at close quarters against the Mongol horsemen.</p>
<p class="para-p">Even so, to hurl the lanceae the legionaries had to shift their scuta and expose themselves to the rain of Mongol arrows. Some legionaries went down immediately, but the javelins were on their way, over the heads of the Hesperians on foot and into the Shappans and Mongol horsemen who followed them. The second rank stepped past the first, their own spears at the ready, but the Mongol front line was almost upon them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now the prisoners revolted. Some dropped to the ground to scurry forward on their hands and knees. Others turned on their Shappan tormenters. It became a messy brawl of Hesperians, becoming increasingly compressed as they were trapped between the lines of advancing Romans and Mongols.</p>
<p class="para-p">The new front rank of Romans threw their spears and fell into close order, scuta overlapping. More spears flew from ranks farther back, over the heads of their brothers in arms. The Romans had the Mongols’ range now, and as Marcellinus had expected, the Mongol horsemen broke away, wheeling around again to send more arrows into the Roman lines.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page350" title="350"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had ordered his front line eased at the critical moment to give at least some of the prisoners a chance to escape through his ranks. The hand-talking adjutants had sent the word to the prisoners, and the calmer among them had cooperated in their own salvation. In some places the plan had fallen short, and many Hesperians now lay dead in front of the Roman lines. But Marcellinus suspected that the Mongols had been banking on a much higher level of chaos, with countless corpses impeding the Roman advance. That had not happened. Lives had been saved.</p>
<p class="para-p">Yet there was little respite. Behind the prisoners the Shappa Ta’atani, perhaps as many as two thousand of them, marched in tight formation directly toward the center of Marcellinus’s line. They wore an odd mixture of Roman and Mongol helmets, Roman breastplates and greaves, and Mongol leather armor, but in terms of their discipline and the rigor of their ranked formation they might have given the First Cahokian a run for their money.</p>
<p class="para-p">More shouted commands from Marcellinus, more cornu blasts and bellowing of centurions. The cohorts of the Sixth Ferrata once again stepped forward to hurl spears, and perhaps one man in four of the Shappan front line fell wounded.</p>
<p class="para-p">Other Shappan braves stepped up to take their place. The warriors of Shappa Ta’atan formed a solid core of infantry. On either side came the wings of Mongol cavalry, again shooting wave upon wave of arrows into the cohorts of the Sixth Ferrata. Relatively few legionaries were going down, though. The Sixth was not nicknamed the Ironclads for nothing; they were heavily armored and quick to adopt a defensive posture, the men at the front kneeling with scuta aslant, those behind standing with shields held above their heads. The Mongols could not inflict high casualties on such a formation with arrow fire alone.</p>
<p class="para-p">Well. Suffice it to say that this was already a completely different battle from the one that the Imperator and Praetors had envisaged just that morning.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus could not see Son of the Sun. The Shappan chief must be within his army somewhere—Marcellinus couldn’t imagine the clan chiefs and warriors of Shappa Ta’atan fighting for the Khan under any other commander—but Marcellinus could not spot him. Once he did, sparks would fly.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page351" title="351"/>
<p class="para-p">The first three ranks of the legion stepped forward, spears held overarm, ready to be thrust down into the Shappan ranks. They advanced in silence, and Marcellinus could see that this unnerved the Shappans. In response, they began to whoop and catcall and bang their axes, clubs, and swords against their shields. But Roma would not be cowed by that.</p>
<p class="para-p">Scores of the Mongols’ erstwhile prisoners had emerged from the back of the first line of cohorts. They were being gathered together by the optios and hustled back toward the water wagons to be held under guard in case of treachery. Marcellinus expected none. Few wore warrior tattoos, and they looked battered and beaten.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Back, sir,” said his adjutant, Furnius. “Come back now…Here they come!”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols were charging. They would attack on either side of their Shappa Ta’atani vassals, their left wing attacking the First Cohort and their right focused on routing Paulinus’s Fourth.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was Marcellinus’s first view of a full Mongol charge. He hoped it would not be his last.</p></div></body></html>

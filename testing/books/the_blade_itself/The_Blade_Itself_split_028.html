<div id="filepos751602" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Next</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I notice you have a new secretary,” said Glokta, as though just in passing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector smiled. “Of course. The old one was not to my liking. He had a loose tongue, you know.” Glokta paused, his wine glass halfway to his mouth. “He had been passing our secrets on to the Mercers,” continued Sult carelessly, as if it was common knowledge. “I had been aware of it for some time. You needn’t worry though, he never learned anything I didn’t want him to know.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Then… you knew who our traitor was. You knew all along.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta’s mind turned the events of the last few weeks around, pulled them apart and put them back together in this new light, trying them different ways until they fit, all the while struggling to conceal his surprise. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">You left Rews confession where you knew your secretary would see it. You knew the Mercers would find out who was on the list, and you guessed what they would do, knowing it would only play into your hands and give you the shovel with which to bury them. Meanwhile, you steered my suspicions towards Kalyne when you knew who the leak was all along. The whole business unfolded precisely according to your plan.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The Arch Lector was looking back at him with a knowing smile. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And I bet you guess what I’m thinking right now. I have been almost as much a piece in this game as that snivelling worm of a secretary.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta stifled a giggle. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">How fortunate for me that I was a piece on the right side. I never suspected a thing.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He betrayed us for a disappointingly small sum of money,” continued Sult, his lip curling with distaste. “I daresay Kault would have given him ten times as much, if he had only had the wit to ask. The younger generation really have no ambition. They think they are a great deal cleverer than they are.” He studied Glokta with his cool blue eyes. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I am part of the younger generation, more or less. I am justly humbled.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Your secretary has been disciplined?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector placed his glass carefully down on the table top, the base barely making a sound on the wood. “Oh yes. Most severely. It really isn’t necessary to spare him any further thought.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I bet it isn’t. Body found floating by the docks…</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “I must say, I was greatly surprised when you fixed on Superior Kalyne as the source of our leak. The man was from the old guard. A few indulgences to look the other way over trifling matters, of course, but to betray the Inquisition? To sell our secrets to the Mercers?” Sult snorted. “Never. You allowed your personal dislike for the man to cloud your judgement.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He seemed the only possibility,” muttered Glokta, but immediately regretted it. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Foolish, foolish. The mistake is made. Better just to keep your mouth shut.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Seemed?” The Arch Lector clicked his tongue in profound disapproval. “No, no, no, Inquisitor. Seemed is not good enough for us. In future, we’ll have just the facts, if you please. But don’t feel too badly about it—I allowed you to follow your instincts and, as things have turned out, your blunder has left our position much the stronger. Kalyne has been removed from office,” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Body found floating…</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “and Superior Goyle is on his way from Angland to assume the role of Superior of Adua.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Goyle? Coming here? That bastard, the new Superior of Adua?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta could not prevent his lip from curling.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The two of you are not the greatest of friends, eh, Glokta?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He is a jailer, not an investigator. He is not interested in guilt or innocence. He is not interested in truth. He tortures for the thrill of it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh, come now, Glokta. Are you telling me you feel no thrill when your prisoners spill their secrets? When they name the names? When they sign the confession?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I take no pleasure in it.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I take no pleasure in anything.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And yet you do it so very well. In any case, Goyle is coming, and whatever you may think of him, he is one of us. A most capable and trustworthy man, dedicated to the service of crown and state. He was once a pupil of mine, you know.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Really?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes. He had your job… so there is some future in it after all!” The Arch Lector giggled at his own joke. Glokta gave a thin smile of his own. “All in all, things have worked out very nicely, and you are to be congratulated on your part in it. A job well done.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Well enough done that I am still alive, at least.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Sult raised his glass and they drank a joyless toast together, eyeing each other suspiciously over the rims of their glasses.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta cleared his throat. “Magister Kault mentioned something interesting before his unfortunate demise.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Go on.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Mercers had a partner in their schemes. A senior partner, perhaps. A bank.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh. Turn a merchant over and there’s always a banker underneath. What of it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I believe these bankers knew about it all. The smuggling, the fraud, the murders even. I believe they encouraged it, maybe ordered it, so that they could get a good return on their loans. May I begin an investigation, your Eminence?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Which bank?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Valint and Balk.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Arch Lector seemed to consider a moment, staring at Glokta through his hard, blue eyes. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Does he already know about these particular bankers? Does he already know much more than me? What did Kault say? You want traitors, Glokta? Look in the House of Questions</span></span><span class="calibre3">—</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No,” snapped Sult. “Those particular bankers are well connected. They are owed too many favours, and without Kault it will be difficult to prove anything. We got what we needed from the Mercers, and I have a more pressing task for you.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta looked up. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Another task?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “I was looking forward to interviewing the prisoners we took at the Guildhall, your Eminence, it may be that—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No.” The Arch Lector swatted Glokta’s words away with his gloved hand. “That business could drag on for months. I will have Goyle handle it.” He frowned. “Unless you object?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">So I plough the field, sow the seed, water the crop, then Goyle reaps the harvest? Some justice.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He humbly bowed his head. “Of course not, your Eminence.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good. You are probably aware of the unusual visitors we received yesterday.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Visitors?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> For the past week Glokta had been in agony with his back. Yesterday he had struggled out of bed to watch that cretin Luthar fence, but otherwise he had been confined to his tiny room, virtually unable to move. “I hadn’t noticed,” he said simply.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bayaz, the First of the Magi.” Glokta gave his thin smile again, but the Arch Lector was not laughing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re joking, of course.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“If only.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A charlatan, your Eminence?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What else? But a most extraordinary one. Lucid, reasonable, clever. The deception is elaborate in the extreme.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You have spoken with him?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I have. He is remarkably convincing. He knows things, things he shouldn’t know. He cannot be simply dismissed. Whoever he is, he has funding, and good sources of information.” The Arch Lector frowned deep. “He has some renegade brute of a Northman with him.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta frowned. “A Northman? It hardly seems their style. They strike me as most direct.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“My very thoughts.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A spy for the Emperor then? The Gurkish?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Perhaps. The Kantics love a good intrigue, but they tend to stick to the shadows. These theatricals don’t seem to have their mark. I suspect our answer may lie closer to home.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The nobles, your Eminence? Brock? Isher? Heugen?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Perhaps,” mused Sult, “perhaps. They’re annoyed enough. Or there’s our old friend, the High Justice. He seemed a little too pleased about it all. He’s plotting something, I can tell.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The nobles, the High Justice, the Northmen, the Gurkish—it could be any one of them, or none—but why?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “I don’t understand, Arch Lector. If they are simply spies, why go to all this trouble? Surely there are easier ways to get into the Agriont?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“This is the thing.” Sult gave as bitter a grimace as Glokta had ever seen. “There is an empty seat on the Closed Council, there always has been. A pointless tradition, a matter of etiquette, a chair reserved for a mythical figure, in any case dead for hundreds of years. Nobody ever supposed that anyone would come forward to claim it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But he has?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“He has! He has demanded it!” The Arch Lector got to his feet and strode around the table. “I know! Unthinkable! Some spy, some liar from who knows where, privy to the workings of the very heart of our government! But he has some dusty papers, so it falls to </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">us</span></span><span class="calibre3"> to discredit </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">him</span></span><span class="calibre3">! Can you believe it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta could not. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But there hardly seems any purpose to saying so.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I have asked for time to investigate,” continued Sult, “but the Closed Council will not be put off indefinitely. We have only a week or two to expose this so-called Magus for the fraud he is. In the mean time, he and his companions are making themselves at home in an excellent suite of rooms in the Tower of Chains, and there is nothing we can do to prevent them wandering the Agriont, causing whatever mischief they please!” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">There is something we could do…</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The Tower of Chains is very high. If somebody were to fall—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No. Not yet. We have already pushed our luck as far as it will go in certain circles. For the time being at least, we must tread carefully.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“There is always the possibility of an interrogation. If we were to arrest them, I could soon find out who they are working for—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Tread carefully, I said! I want you to look into this Magus, Glokta, and his companions. Find out who they are, where they come from, what they are after. Above all, find out who is behind them, and why. We must discredit this would-be Bayaz before he can do any damage. After that you can use whatever means you please.” Sult turned and moved away to the window.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta got up awkwardly, painfully from his chair. “How shall I begin?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Follow them!” shouted the Arch Lector impatiently. “Watch them! See who they speak to, what they are about. You’re the Inquisitor, Glokta!” he snapped, without even looking round. “Ask some questions!”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_28"></div></div></body>

<p class="para-pf-alt" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">“I</span>t was a trap,” Marcellinus said, and lifted the beaker of water to his lips. His throat was seared, both from the smoke and from his frantic screaming at his troops. Horrific images still loomed before his eyes, sickening him. “A double trap.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Too tired and battered to stand, he sat on a camp stool in the Imperium tent in the middle of Forward Camp. He had pulled out most of the slivers of pottery that had lacerated his hands, but he was still dripping blood onto the floor. In front of him stood the Imperator and Lucius Agrippa. To his left were Tahtay, Sintikala, and Enopay, all staring at him with the same shocked disbelief as the Romans. Hanska stood by his side, sweating and glowering. She had refused to leave him, apparently fearing that he might be killed by his own leaders.</p>
<p class="para-p">Behind him the centurion of the Sixth, who had led the evening’s action, stood rigidly at attention and stared at a fixed point in space somewhere over his Imperator’s left shoulder. The centurion’s face was plastered in mud, ash, and blood. Hanska’s face was equally dirty. Marcellinus doubted that he looked any better himself.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Obviously a trap,” Hadrianus said. “But perhaps we could trouble you to be a little more specific.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus took another drink of water and spoke again, swallowing almost convulsively every few words against the smarting in his throat. “A Mongol special unit. Creeping forward under cover of darkness. They set up a trebuchet behind a low rise and used it to bombard the camp. They struck the Thunderbird launcher. Other damage.” They nodded impatiently. They all knew about the damage to the camp.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page318" title="318"/>
<p class="para-p">He took a little more water, and anger strengthened his voice. “I went out with several centuries of the Sixth Ferrata and horsemen of the Third Cahokian. The Mongols set fire to their trebuchet, left their slaves behind, and withdrew.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Slaves?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes. The Mongol trebuchets use human power in a concerted effort to throw the missiles. Pulling on the ropes, all together, thirty or fifty at a time. The Mongols had brought Hesperian prisoners, mostly Shoshoni and Hidatsa. The prisoners launched the missiles. Then the Mongols abandoned them to be cut down by our legionaries.” Again Marcellinus felt sick. “It didn’t feel right. Even in the dark I half recognized the languages they were speaking. They sounded familiar and not like the Mongol tongue…Anyway, the Mongols had armed the prisoners and told them the Romans would slay them. Half of them believed it, fought us in their panic. The other half begged for mercy. The legionaries did not understand them. Dozens were dead before I could order the stand-down.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay briefly closed his eyes. “Again Romans killing Hesperians.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Not deliberately. It was not the fault of the legionaries, Tahtay. You must see that.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay raised his arm in a slicing motion, the hand-talk for <em class="char-i">be silent</em>. “Of course I understand. I am not an idiot. But now I must explain to my warriors that Romans have once again cut down people of the land.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And that should make them hate the Mongols more,” said Enopay. “Not the Romans.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps. It may not be that simple.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Only a score or so of the Mongols’ prisoners had survived. They had been herded into camp, bleeding and wailing in shock, sorrow, and understandable anger. They were men who had been pushed to their wits’ end on the Mongols’ leash and then had been almost hacked to death by Roma.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page319" title="319"/>
<p class="para-p">Lucius Agrippa could contain himself no longer. “Yes, yes, but in the meantime, Chagatai’s army is here.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Maybe,” Tahtay said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Agrippa eyed him balefully. “There is no <em class="char-i">maybe</em>, war chief. We have flown Sky Lanterns. Sintikala has flown her Hawk. We see their camp, not ten miles distant, and their campfires as they warm themselves against the dawn chill. Their dust still hangs in the air. Somehow their entire army has crept in, undetected.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay looked at Sintikala. “Speak.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala pursed her lips and spoke reluctantly. “Not so many.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Not so many as what?” Agrippa demanded.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala frowned at his tone and for a moment did not reply. Then she answered in Cahokian, still eschewing speaking Latin in front of the Imperator, with Enopay deftly translating. “ ‘By night I saw them from the air. Hundreds of campfires, just ten miles from Forward Camp, which would mean that thousands of men had arrived by night. A whole army. You launched a Sky Lantern in the dawn, and your Roman sentries, pilots, they told you the same. But it is not so.’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">“A ruse,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“ ‘Which they worked to conceal.’ ” Enopay heard more from Sintikala, then nodded. “ ‘An advance group of perhaps three or four jaghuns, just a few hundred men, must have ridden in at night, dragging branches behind them to throw dust into the air. Each man lit a fire. By night the camp has the appearance of the full army, but it is not so. When I flew again at dawn, the ruse became clear.’ ”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yet more Mongol trickery.” The Imperator turned to Agrippa. “Has it worked? How is the mood in camp?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Agrippa looked frustrated. “Word has already spread throughout the armies. Naturally we all believed an entire Mongol army had closed to within striking distance without our knowing they were there. The legions are shaken, and the redskins are all aquiver that we have killed Hesperians in cold blood.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus nodded. “Steps?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We have closed the gate between the inner castra and the outer camp. I have told my centurions they are personally responsible for keeping their men calm. On pain of death.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page320" title="320"/>
<p class="para-p">“Our commanders and elders, too,” Tahtay said. “Akecheta, Mahkah, Wahchintonka, Matoshka, Chenoa. The Tadodaho and other chiefs of the Iroqua, Blackfoot, Cherokee. All walk the camp, speaking softly for calm.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus spoke. “I will have the Sixth Ironclads build the rest of the launchers, bring in the other Hawks and Eagles, and put the outer camp to rights. I already sent out two centuries to tear down the Mongol trebuchets and…clean up after the slaughter. Bring the bodies in for burial.”</p>
<p class="para-p">After a short, morbid silence, Hadrianus shook his head. “Damn these Mongol bastards to Hades.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus considered. “To get here these jaghuns must have come sixty or eighty miles a day for several days. We should launch an attack on them right away, while they’re still tired. Their warriors may sleep in the saddle, but when do their horses sleep? They will be fatigued; some may even be foundered. And we must show our troops and warriors that the Khan’s troops are not invincible.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator was nodding. “Decinius Sabinus already musters the Third for deployment.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Surely you just have to tell the army what is really happening,” Enopay said. “And then we—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Gods’ sakes, Gaius Marcellinus, shut your word slave up before I slit his annoying throat.” The Imperator turned on his heel and strode out of the room.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay stared after him, eyes wide. “What? What? I spoke the wrong words?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You spoke words,” Agrippa said drily. “And that was quite enough.” He nodded to Marcellinus and followed his Imperator out of the tent.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala put her hand on Enopay’s shoulder to comfort him but turned to Marcellinus. “And so now we attack the Mongols?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus wanted nothing more than to sleep for a few hours. That obviously wasn’t going to happen. He gulped water again, stood. “Us? That’s up to the Imperator. Soon, Sabinus will march the Third Parthica. In the meantime we must ensure that the remaining launch towers are being constructed correctly. We do not have long. The rest of Chagatai’s army will not be far behind.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page321" title="321"/>
<p class="para-sp">By midmorning the Legio III Parthica had deployed from Forward Camp and marched due west. Heavily outnumbered, Chagatai’s Mongols chose not to engage them in battle. As soon as the legion came within a quarter mile, the jaghuns withdrew slowly ahead of them. Praetor Decinius Sabinus halted his men, whereupon the Mongol horsemen also stopped and dismounted. Sabinus commanded his troops forward once more, and again the few hundred Mongol light cavalry led their horses away.</p>
<p class="para-p">In the rear of the Third Legion its engineers set up a launching ramp, stoked a flame to inflate the bag, and sent a Sky Lantern aloft with a mixed crew of four legionaries and four members of the Raven clan. Tethered to a barbed pole driven deep into the ground, the Sky Lantern rose a thousand feet into the air, and its crew took stock of the land before them to ensure that they were not being led into an ambush or flanked by another Mongol force.</p>
<p class="para-p">What happened next was as visible to the rest of the army waiting at Forward Camp as it was to the crew of the Sky Lantern. Marcellinus saw it, too, from his perch atop the third Thunderbird launch tower where he stood with Chenoa supervising the installation of the steel launching rail.</p>
<p class="para-p">At first it was merely a smudge on the far horizon. Then the message was taken up, and just minutes later the signal tower ten miles south of Forward Camp showed its flame, the gouts of smoke it produced being artfully sculpted with a blanket to produce a series of small black clouds that drifted up into the blue skies.</p>
<p class="para-p">The signal fires had been lit. At long last, the Line of Hadrianus had served its purpose. Its message was clear. The second and much larger army, that of Chinggis Khan, was also on its way and only a few days distant.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page322" title="322"/>
<p class="para-p">The Mongols had timed their approach to perfection, the twin punches of the armies of Chagatai and Chinggis artfully coordinated. Another wave of alarm spread through Forward Camp.</p>
<p class="para-p">Chinggis Khan had seized the initiative before he had even crossed the horizon. The Roman coalition had already been forced onto the defensive. The allies had to recapture their morale and momentum, and soon, or the war would be already half lost.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Two days later Marcellinus stepped up to take his place as part of a Wakinyan crew at the ground end of one of the giant rails. Around him the others in his crew all prepared themselves for launch in their own way, some stretching, others frowning at the sky and muttering in prayer. Chenoa’s eyes roved over the craft and the tower, searching for any signs of defect. Demothi walked back and forth underneath the Wakinyan Seven and touched each spar and rod, also obsessively checking for any weakness. Luyu and Taianita were already strapped under the craft, one on each side. Luyu had been one of the crew when the Thunderbirds of Tahtay had bombed the Roman fortresses on the Oyo, and so she wore a battle tattoo and a falcon mask. Taianita, less experienced, had no mask to hide her trepidation. She chewed her lip and stared at the ground. The two braves who completed the crew were not known to Marcellinus and said no word to him. They sang their preflight rituals, then gestured to him to step up so that they could lift him into position and strap him in place.</p>
<p class="para-p">The first Mongol army had appeared over the horizon to the northwest the previous afternoon, a broad swath of armed horsemen advancing at a walk, grazing their mounts as they came. This was the army of Chagatai, second son of Chinggis Khan. It had crossed the Great Mountains to the north and proceeded along the Wemissori, destroying Shoshoni, Blackfoot, Hidatsa, and Mandan communities as it came. The advance strike force of Mongols responsible for the morale-sapping night attack had fallen back to join up with the main army.</p>
<p class="para-p">Chagatai’s army clearly felt under no pressure to hurry. Mongol control of the meadows ahead meant less grazing land for the Roman four-legs, requiring them to ferry the horses squadron by squadron back across the river to the prairies behind them. The Romans had already moved the mules far downriver to preserve the nearer grass for the horses.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page323" title="323"/>
<p class="para-p">The larger army, led by Chinggis himself, was only a little farther away. As the Romans had long known, the Mongol Khan had brought his forces across the lower reaches of the Great Mountains, crossing them via a southern pass, and was now advancing eastward along the Braided River.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Norse scouts of the Third Parthica had penetrated close to the Mongol baggage train before being chased away. The Norsemen reported that the army of Chinggis Khan still maintained its appearance of being the most cheerful and colorful they had ever seen. Their enemies’ spirits were high. The carts appeared to contain trebuchets broken down into transportable parts and cargoes of metal tubing that were presumably fire lances. The largest and widest of the carts carried the Khan’s yurt, all in one piece, and that cart required twenty horses to pull it.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Norsemen had kept shaking their heads as they briefed the Praetors on what they had seen. The Mongol Horde was enough to daunt even a Viking.</p>
<p class="para-p">At that point the scouts had completed their useful work. They would not be allowed so close to the enemy forces again. Chagatai’s army now had squads of skirmishers riding out two miles ahead to clear the way and check for traps and ambushes and engage or drive away any Romans foolish enough to approach. Any Romans who tried to scout Chinggis’s army from now on risked being cut off from Forward Camp.</p>
<p class="para-p">Thus, to gain any further strategic information about the approaching armies, they would have to take to the air.</p>
<p class="para-p">This would be Marcellinus’s sixth flight aboard a Wakinyan Seven, but as Chenoa and Sintikala were even now continuing to experiment with the design, this craft bore only a superficial resemblance to those he had flown previously. This Seven had just over half the wingspan of one of the full twelve-man Thunderbirds and a much more swept-back wing shape, with the larger pilots carried toward the center. Demothi would be in the central lead position, and Chenoa would captain the craft from the outermost point of the left wing. To Demothi’s left would be Marcellinus, Taianita, and then Chenoa; to his right, the other two male pilots and then Luyu. The girl was so slight that she carried the lion’s share of the weaponry, mostly pots of liquid flame. Chenoa also carried some liquid flame and Demothi bore one of Marcellinus’s new slingshots, but Marcellinus and the others were unarmed.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page324" title="324"/>
<p class="para-p">They carried no sacks of incendiary so that they would be lighter and more nimble in the air. This would be purely a reconnaissance flight. They planned to stay high, and to deter the possibility of an attack by a Mongol Firebird, their Wakinyan would be escorted by half a dozen Catanwakuwa piloted by Sintikala, Kimimela, and others of the Hawk clan.</p>
<p class="para-p">As always for Marcellinus, the launch consisted of what seemed like a half hour of agonized waiting, not daring to breathe while expecting each moment to be his last, followed by a swift punch to his spine that would have done credit to a mule and then a vertiginous floating-dropping sensation as the Thunderbird found its place in the air. If anything, watching the launch tower streak past his eyes was even more terrifying than rocketing off the Great Mound of Cahokia. The wooden tower that felt so solid when he was standing on it now seemed flimsy, as if it might buckle beneath them or simply blow away and cease to exist in the instants it took the Thunderbird to streak up the oiled steel rail and into the sky.</p>
<p class="para-p">The outer edges of the wings unfurled and locked, revealing the prone bodies of Chenoa and Luyu at the wingtips. Marcellinus heard an eerie keening sound over the hum of the wind in the cables of steel and sinew. Luyu was singing, of all things, in a tuneless girlish soprano.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus loosened his death grip on the rod in front of him and tried to focus on the land beneath. Experience had taught him that if he clutched it too tightly, his surge of terror when the ground came into clear view made him flinch and jerk the craft to one side. But until today his flights had all been over Cahokia, with its recognizable mounds, huts, longhouses, granaries, and borrow pits. From this altitude the prairie appeared featureless. He could see the horizon, a few indistinct curves of the Braided River to his left, and a smudge that might be the distant Wemissori off the right wingtip, but beneath him he could not identify hills, valleys, or even a copse of trees. As a result, he had no idea how high he was.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page325" title="325"/>
<p class="para-p">Chenoa called out, laconic words of command that Marcellinus and the others instantly obeyed. The Seven banked to change its course by a few degrees.</p>
<p class="para-p">Somewhere nearby were the Hawks of Sintikala, Kimimela, and the others, but Marcellinus could not see them. The sky was lined with high cloud, gray rather than blue, and he saw no other wings. Perhaps they were above him, blocked from his view by the taut wing of the Thunderbird. Luyu mercifully fell silent, her song at an end. No one spoke. Marcellinus felt isolated, adrift in a gray world, and after a few minutes began to suffer from the odd illusion that they were suspended stationary in space and might be trapped up there, unable to come down.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then he realized that the ground below was no longer featureless. He made every effort not to wrench at his control bar in his shock.</p>
<p class="para-p">They had already reached the Mongol army of Chagatai. The Thunderbird was flying over the leading edge of a sea of warriors.</p>
<p class="para-p">The grass beneath him resembled nothing so much as a rug covered with ants. Chagatai’s forces were not riding in blocks like Roman cavalry but were spread out in small groups sparsely enough that they appeared to stretch to the horizon on both sides. They were grazing their horses as they walked and staying far enough apart that a full-sized Thunderbird with a cargo of liquid flame would do little damage.</p>
<p class="para-p">How the hell high was he? How could they have gained so much height? Was it a trick of the air?</p>
<p class="para-p">“Down,” Chenoa said calmly at just that moment. They inched the bars closer to their chests. The horizon tilted. The Thunderbird angled down toward the prairie. Now he could pick out the wagon train in the center of Chagatai’s army.</p>
<p class="para-p">A Hawk appeared less than fifty feet to his left. Beyond, another dropped into formation next to it. The Wakinyan was vibrating, its sinews thrumming in the air, and for a moment he could not tell who the Hawk pilots were.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page326" title="326"/>
<p class="para-p">“South?” Demothi was asking Chenoa. “Along?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes.” The Thunderbird banked again. Rather than travel farther behind the Mongol line, they were going to ride along it. “And lower.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Chagatai himself would be somewhere below them, a warrior chief in his early forties, already a leader of great renown in his own right. Marcellinus wondered if the Mongol general could see the Thunderbird above him, if he was aware he was being surveilled.</p>
<p class="para-p">As they dropped, Marcellinus made more sense of what he was seeing. The Mongol light cavalry were mostly dressed in leather, a gray-brown color that from altitude naturally merged into the green-gray of the prairie. But now they were flying over a block of Mongol heavy cavalry in darker leather and steel. Unlike the light horsemen, the heavies rode in ranks in a solid block. If the light cavalry seemed ephemeral from the air, the heavies looked substantial, square, steely, and ready for anything.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus could not count them or even estimate their numbers. He doubted that anyone else aboard the Thunderbird could either.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Canoes.” Taianita pointed without moving her hand far from her wooden control bar. The Wakinyan Sevens were light enough that even stretching out an arm had a noticeable effect.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus screwed up his eyes, but for him they were just dark blips on the Wemissori. “You’re sure?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of course. Large. Probably of wood rather than birch bark.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tlingit, then, rather than the lightweight canoes of the lakes and eastern woodlands. They must have been portaged over the northern mountains, perhaps by Hesperian slave labor. The Tlingit were a coastal tribe and would prefer riverine travel to a long trek on land. Those vessels carried warriors and supplies.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Enough,” Chenoa said. “On.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Everyone but Marcellinus seemed to know immediately what “on” meant. The Thunderbird banked sharply left away from the river, heading southwest. Chenoa shared Sintikala’s uncanny reading of the skies; in changing direction she somehow nursed the unseen air currents and coaxed their craft higher. He supposed it was a trick akin to that of mariners who could read the color of the seas, the patterns of the wave tops, the almost imperceptible surface currents, and even the birds in the skies and the clouds and stars above them to steer the best course. Perhaps if you flew all your life, if you practically lived in the air, this was the kind of virtuosity you could aspire to.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page327" title="327"/>
<p class="para-p">Was Marcellinus that good at anything? Had he gained any skill over his half century of life that was even remotely similar? Well, to a man or woman of peace his speed with a sword and his reading of his enemy’s movements might appear similarly uncanny…at least, he might hope so.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then his woolgathering was dispelled, because just a few miles from Chagatai’s forces he saw the even larger army of Chagatai’s father, Chinggis Khan, the scourge of Asia and the implacable, ruthless foe of Roma.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Marcellinus’s first hope was that he was mistaken, that they were really looking down upon one of the gigantic buffalo herds that might take a full day to pass by raft or horse. But the beasts below did not have the ungainly gait of buffalo. These were warriors on horseback, each leading several other horses, and there were carts sprinkled among them, too, tall-wheeled wagons similar to those the Romans and Hesperians had constructed for overland travel. This was an army of countless thousands of cavalry on the move. They were not organized into rigid units or even an established marching order like Roman cavalry. The Mongols were spread across the plains like a disease.</p>
<p class="para-p">He realized that there was, after all, a shape to the Mongol formation. They were flying over the leading edge of an immense curve. The forces of the Khan were arranged in a loose circle. Within that circle, a massive but meandering group of Mongol horsemen formed a vanguard. Marcellinus’s Thunderbird had already flown over the front of the left wing of the Mongol army, and far in the distance he could see the right. Interspersed between the groups of horsemen were foot soldiers, perhaps their Hesperian allies.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page328" title="328"/>
<p class="para-p">Somewhere in the center of this group would be the Keshiks, the thousand-strong personal guard of Chinggis Khan. But they were still too far away to be seen.</p>
<p class="para-p">His fellow Wakinyan pilots had fallen silent. The wind soughed gently in the sinews and spars of the craft. For several minutes they had flown straight, taking in the scale of the army beneath. Only now did Marcellinus realize with a shock how much easier it had become to distinguish individual horses and riders. They were only, what, a couple of thousand feet above the army?</p>
<p class="para-p">“Enough,” he said. “We should go back. Chenoa?”</p>
<p class="para-p">In a low tone, Chenoa gave the orders. The Thunderbird made a series of gentle turns in the air as she rode the complex breezes to sustain their altitude, and they turned east to ride the waves of air back toward the Roman lines.</p>
<p class="para-p">None of the other pilots seemed concerned that they might lose too much height and be forced to land close to the Mongol army. Just a little earlier Marcellinus had felt safe, insulated from danger by thousands of feet of altitude. Now he felt incredibly vulnerable. What if they suffered a piloting error, a shift in the tension of the thin skins that made up the wing or the sinews that kept it taut? What if the winds changed? Marcellinus wanted to be away from here, back on the ground, surrounded by the allied forces of Roma and Nova Hesperia.</p>
<p class="para-p">And then the reason his instinct for danger had clicked in became apparent. With shocking speed, Sintikala’s Hawk shot past them and curved upward, waggling her wings.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Firebird,” Taianita said calmly. “Two. Back left.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The frame of the Thunderbird jerked. Chenoa glanced at Marcellinus in irritation, although he was sure it had not been his fault; his hands were loose around the control bar. “Sorry,” Luyu said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Two Mongol Firebirds were arcing up behind them at a speed that seemed impossible, side by side, still gaining height. Marcellinus could not see the light hempen cables that pulled them skyward, but he could certainly see the horses on the ground that were towing them aloft: two groups of a dozen horsemen riding in a close four-by-three formation. A lane opened up in front of them as other horsemen and Hesperian warriors moved aside.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page329" title="329"/>
<p class="para-p">Chenoa snapped orders. Marcellinus obeyed instinctively as she tightened the angle of the Thunderbird against the air, pointing the nose slightly downward, and then felt another jolt of alarm. Chenoa was putting the Wakinyan Seven into a shallow dive to increase its speed, but surely that would diminish the amount of time the bird could stay in the air…</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela flew by, far above them and to the right. Marcellinus was relieved to see that she was leaving the area, streaking east. Either the wind currents at her altitude were stronger or his daughter was somehow fueled by terror.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol Firebirds were already a thousand feet higher than their Wakinyan and still gaining altitude. The squad of horsemen towing them aloft was slowing. “Cables dropped,” Demothi said, although Marcellinus could not see them falling back to earth.</p>
<p class="para-p">Luyu’s pots of Hesperian liquid flame and her bow and arrow would be of use only against targets on the ground. They were powerless to protect them from the Firebirds.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Something else launching,” Taianita said. Some remote part of Marcellinus’s brain admired her calm even as he looked back. Two other squads of horsemen were advancing at speed, this time much larger than twelve cavalrymen each. The nearer squad was at a canter, the farther one overhauling them at a full gallop, and as the two groups met, the nearer squad dropped away, its horses blown.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Handoff,” said Demothi.</p>
<p class="para-p">Was that possible? Could the two Mongol groups really have passed something between them?</p>
<p class="para-p">Yes. A cable. And now they could see the aerial craft that cable was hauling up from the ground.</p>
<p class="para-p">They were looking at a new type of winged vehicle, one they had never seen before, several times longer than the Firebirds.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page330" title="330"/>
<p class="para-p">The larger Thunderbirds of Cahokia were twelve men wide. This craft looked as if it were a dozen men <em class="char-i">long</em>, as if four Firebirds had been attached in a row, equipped with larger wings, and thrown aloft. It rippled sinuously, writhing into the skies, and its provenance was clear in its coloration of red, gold, and green.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Damn,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">A flash came from high in the sky ahead of them, then another and a third. “And what’s <em class="char-i">that</em>?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Kimimela signals Roma,” Taianita said. “Summoning help for us.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Good.” Because, gods knew, they needed it.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Firebirds were above and behind them now. The new snakelike aerial craft was gaining speed and height so rapidly that it was overtaking the Mongol squad that hauled it aloft.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was much closer now, and the way it undulated combined with Marcellinus’s fear to make him nauseous. Its resemblance to the feathered serpent of Yokot’an Maya iconography was obvious. Its lead pilot was wearing a gray mask and a bright feathered headdress.</p>
<p class="para-p">This new creation looked and breathed Maya. They were being attacked by a flying craft of the People of the Sun, a craft they had not even known existed.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Options?” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Chenoa ignored him. She was peering to the left and right of them with a look of absorbed distraction.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Fly away fast,” Demothi said. “No other choice. Now hush, Wanageeska.”</p>
<p class="para-p">They were passing over the front line of Chinggis’s army, but with yet another pulse of fear Marcellinus saw that several squads of skirmishers were trotting out ahead of it, following the Thunderbird’s direction. Right now the Wakinyan was outpacing them, but for how long?</p>
<p class="para-p">“Left, follow me,” Chenoa said. Marcellinus and the others noted the position of her hands and smoothly followed her motions. The right wingtip tilted up sharply as they caught some invisible air current that only Chenoa could see. “Woo,” said Luyu, whose stomach must have just dropped away from her. And then, “Oh…”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page331" title="331"/>
<p class="para-p">“Shit!” Marcellinus shouted.</p>
<p class="para-p">A Mongol Firebird swooped by just thirty feet away. Arrows whistled past Marcellinus’s face, and the Wakinyan lurched as something heavy thumped into the wing just above Demothi. He and Chenoa both jerked to shove the craft back onto its original bearing. The rest of the pilots held steady.</p>
<p class="para-p">From the other side came the Hawk of Sintikala, streaking from left to right a hundred feet higher. She, too, was shooting arrows, although Marcellinus was too busy to see if any hit the Firebird.</p>
<p class="para-p">They were now out in front of the army of Chinggis Khan, and once again Marcellinus could not tell how high above the ground they were. He would just have to trust Chenoa and Demothi.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Feathered Serpent craft writhed, two hundred feet above them but dropping toward them at an alarming rate. Eight men flew it, tugging on cords rather than control bars but lying supine just as the crew of the Thunderbird lay beneath their own craft. Interspersed between those eight hung four other warriors, men whose sole job appeared to be to hurl missiles at the Wakinyan.</p>
<p class="para-p">These missiles came thick and fast now: small rocks mostly, sent on their way by slings. At first they flew safely past the Thunderbird. Then, as the Serpent loomed closer and matched the Thunderbird’s speed, the rocks bounced off the taut material of its wing, each sending a sickening quiver through the craft.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then one of the missiles exploded with the crack of the Jin black powder that was becoming ever more familiar.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">They have our range!</em> Marcellinus wanted to shout to his fellow pilots, but he would just be stating the obvious, and they all had their hands full.</p>
<p class="para-p">From their right came another Firebird. For a few gut-clenching moments it looked as if it would deliberately smash into their Wakinyan, but at the last moment it looped away and dropped below them.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Firebird had been trying to drive Sintikala away, but she was too nimble. Now she swooped up beneath the Serpent. She loosed an arrow, and it smacked squarely into the chest of the Serpent’s lead pilot.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page332" title="332"/>
<p class="para-p">The warrior recoiled but did not scream or release his hold on the steering cords. The arrow had lodged in his armor but failed to pierce it. Nonetheless his violent motion sent the whole Serpent rippling to the right as his fellow pilots had to match his course or face disaster.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Thunderbird wallowed in the air. Marcellinus risked a look back. They were well in front of the Mongol army, which had not changed its pace from a slow amble. He had no idea where the skirmishers were.</p>
<p class="para-p">Beneath them another pot of Jin salt erupted into flame. Taianita screamed, a sound that she quickly cut off. Like Luyu she murmured, “Sorry,” and shook her head.</p>
<p class="para-p">The two Firebirds were losing height. Perhaps they were not as sleek as the Cahokian Hawks or their pilots were not as skilled, but apparently they could not use the unseen air currents to claw back altitude in the way Sintikala and Chenoa often did, and that even Kimimela sometimes could achieve.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Here she comes,” said Luyu, as if she had heard Marcellinus’s thoughts.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sure enough, Kimimela was approaching again from the east, just a few hundred feet above the ground. She could not remain airborne much longer. Why had she come back? What was she playing at? Marcellinus’s stomach lurched.</p>
<p class="para-p">Above them, Sintikala and the Feathered Serpent continued their deadly duel. Marcellinus could not easily see what was going on past the Thunderbird wing, but he was sure that Sintikala’s agile harassment of the Maya craft was all that was saving the Thunderbird from being blown out of the air. The crewmen of the Serpent were still hurling their pots of black powder on what must be suicidally short fuses, but timing the explosions accurately enough to set fire to the Thunderbird would be difficult with Sintikala disrupting their aim.</p>
<p class="para-p">An arrow came through the deerskin of the wing. Marcellinus barely saw the arrow itself, but he heard the <em class="char-i">whoosh</em> of its passing, heard the cry of the man beside him, saw the bright tear that suddenly opened up in the wing. The rip lengthened. “Chenoa?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page333" title="333"/>
<p class="para-p">“I see it,” she said. “Prepare—”</p>
<p class="para-p">An explosion came directly above them. Flame scattered across the deerskin wing.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Dive, dive!” Chenoa shouted.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus swung his head to look downward so quickly that he pulled a muscle in his neck. He could see small bushes below them now, a stream. The ground was still maybe five hundred feet below them, but the other pilots had pulled their control bars into their chests, and the Thunderbird was dropping out of the sky.</p>
<p class="para-p">A stream of Roman invective poured from his mouth. He could not help it.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Gods, shut <em class="char-i">up</em>!” Taianita shouted.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Feet,” Demothi said laconically. “Gaius? <em class="char-i">Feet</em>.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The wing was burning. The ground was coming up fast. Belatedly, Marcellinus kicked free of the retaining bar that his ankles had rested on and swung in his harness, his boots now pointing to the prairie grass beneath them. “Futete…”</p>
<p class="para-p">He heard Kimimela scream from close by, and then Chenoa’s voice cut through it: “Push. Now pull. <em class="char-i">Push!</em>”</p>
<p class="para-p">The nose of the Thunderbird came up. Burning splinters were falling onto Marcellinus’s neck now.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Legs <em class="char-i">up-up-up</em>!” For the first time on this whole flight, Chenoa was screaming.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was almost too late in bending his knees up and away from the impact and forcing himself to relax and not brace. The craft was dangerously unbalanced now. The Thunderbird’s nose flipped upward into the air, throwing them all forward, and the wing crumpled. Marcellinus swung up and found himself looking at sky, and then his feet slammed into the ground and the rest of the burning craft collapsed onto him.</p>
<p class="para-p">The earth seemed to be moving under him, and he felt a strong desire to vomit. His fingers were fumbling at the straps even as he heard a snapping crack next to his head. Luyu and the male Wakinyan pilot whose name he didn’t know were breaking him free from the wreckage of the Thunderbird. Marcellinus staggered forward on wobbly legs, brushing chunks of flaming wood from his neck and shoulders.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page334" title="334"/>
<p class="para-p">“Now <em class="char-i">run</em>,” Chenoa said.</p>
<p class="para-p">He started running without even knowing why, following the others but quickly falling behind. Taianita glanced back, shook her head in frustration, and slowed to wait for him. “Mongols, Wanageeska! Come!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Indeed. Still half a mile away but coming on at a fast trot were the Mongol skirmishers.</p>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">Jove</em>…Suddenly, Marcellinus found himself capable of running much faster. The tallgrass of the prairie tugged at his boots, trying to trip him.</p>
<p class="para-p">He glimpsed movement ahead of him and risked a glance up. A few hundred yards away a Cahokian Hawk landed untidily. Kimimela. <em class="char-i">Damn it.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">A pot bounced on the ground to his left and exploded with a bright flash and a crack. He glanced up in time to see the ripple of the Feathered Serpent as it curved in the air above his head. <em class="char-i">Shit</em>. He swerved left and then right to make himself a harder target, and arrows thwacked into the ground around him. They were shooting at <em class="char-i">him</em> specifically, he realized; none of the others running through the prairie around him were coming under fire. Did the Mongols somehow know who he was? <em class="char-i">Come on, gods. Give me a break here.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">He sucked air into his aching lungs, but it was quickly becoming hopeless. He looked up again just in time to see Sintikala shoot two arrows into the Serpent from above. The first missed, but the second passed right through the Serpent’s feathered wing, and he heard a satisfying scream of pain as the arrow found its mark.</p>
<p class="para-p">Too low, the Serpent was already swinging back toward the Mongol line. But the horses of the skirmishers were closer. <em class="char-i">Shit and shit again.</em></p>
<p class="para-p">“More right! That way!” They had reached Kimimela, who was bouncing on the balls of her feet in frustration. “No, follow me.” She set off at a fleet run but had to slow down immediately; even Chenoa and Luyu were panting now.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala flew over them, waggling her wings. On foot ahead of them, Kimimela adjusted her direction to follow the course her mother indicated. At long last, Marcellinus allowed himself to feel some hope.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page335" title="335"/>
<p class="para-p">For yes, here came the cavalry. Galloping directly toward them across the tall grass were the horsemen of the Chernye Klobuki, the elite light cavalry of the western Asian steppe. Their harnesses jangled and some of them still used their whips, but once they caught sight of the running fugitives, they slowed to a trot. The first turma passed them and took up position between them and the approaching Mongol cavalrymen. The second curved out to the left at a canter, either seeing an enemy in that direction or threatening to flank the skirmishers.</p>
<p class="para-p">The third Chernye turma trotted up to them. Thank the gods, they had brought spare horses.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala landed next to them, unstrapped her wing in two quick urgent movements, and ran to join them. “You came back?” she demanded of Kimimela. “Stupid, stupid!”</p>
<p class="para-p">“<em class="char-i">You</em> landed!” Kimimela shot back. “Stupid?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala looked exasperated. “<em class="char-i">I</em> ran out of air.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And I knew you’d stay and fight until you did. Was I going to leave you both out here? No!”</p>
<p class="para-p">Wearily, Marcellinus pulled himself onto the nearest horse. It eyed him balefully, as if wondering whether to bite him. “Ladies. Can’t this wait?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m with you.” Kimimela took his arm and pulled herself up behind him rather than take a horse of her own. She had been on horseback only a few times before and clearly did not relish it now, especially not with one of the spirited and dangerous Chernye mounts. Still shaking her head angrily, Sintikala also mounted a horse. With varying degrees of agility and assurance, the remaining Wakinyan crew members climbed aboard mounts.</p>
<p class="para-p">The decurion snapped out orders. Behind them the first and second turmae of the Chernye Klobuki merged and began to charge, nocking arrows. Beyond them and just a few hundred yards distant, perhaps fifty Mongol horsemen approached in a broad line. Once they achieved a full gallop, the front of the column curved to the left. The Chernye warriors braced themselves half out of the saddle in caracole formation and began to loose arrows in an attempt to hold the Mongols back. Marcellinus took stock. “Cahokians, we have to move. Chenoa?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page336" title="336"/>
<p class="para-p">Reluctantly, Chenoa stepped into a stirrup and dragged herself aboard a horse. The horse resisted her, tossing its head, but its master leaned forward to knock his whip against its ears in warning. Despite her unfamiliarity with the four-legs, Chenoa maintained her tone of command. “Wakinyan crew? With me. Ride.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Let’s go,” Marcellinus said to the impatient Chernye decurion. The nomad cavalry pulled their whips from their boots and leaned forward in the saddle. The Cahokians’ borrowed mounts high-stepped and snorted, ready for the race home. “Hold on very tightly,” Marcellinus added quickly to his crew. “This ride may be even scarier than the last.”</p></div></body></html>

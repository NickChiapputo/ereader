<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">I</span>t was the first time in the whole war that Marcellinus had seen a sizable contingent of Mongol and Jin infantry. Although technically they were cavalrymen who had dismounted.</p>
<p class="para-p">They were not marching—Mongols had no infantry drills, no concept of advancing in step—but they were at least walking together side by side in open order in two broad ranks of at least two hundred men apiece. Each warrior wore heavy scale armor and carried a fire lance, with a second lance hanging over his shoulder by a leather strap. Behind them came two ranks of heavy cavalry with those heinous hooked spears, and following them were two lines of light horse archers with arrows nocked.</p>
<p class="para-p">Their strategy was obvious. The fire lancers would break the Roman orbis formations, carving them into pieces with flame. The heavies would penetrate the ensuing breaches to slay the legionaries while the archers guarded their rear and shot past them into the mass of men beyond.</p>
<p class="para-p">It would be bloody, fiery slaughter.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Furnius, belay my previous orders. Signal Hanska and the Ninth Syrian to fall in behind me on the double.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You will not lead the charge,” Furnius said flatly. “Can’t let you do it. Caesar’s direct orders.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page418" title="418"/>
<p class="para-p">“I’m overriding them. My responsibility.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Furnius merely shook his head.</p>
<p class="para-p">The hell with it. Marcellinus turned in the saddle, and of course Hanska was watching him from several hundred yards away, ready whenever he needed her. He made several large hand-talk gestures. Hanska nodded and nudged her horse forward, shouting orders to her men. Marcellinus glared at Furnius. “Order the Ninth Syrian to join us, if you would. Without them I’m even more likely to get myself killed. No?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Holy Jupiter…” Furnius shook his head in exasperation and practically sprinted to the cornicen’s side.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Where do you need us, Hotah?” Tahtay asked.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Other side of me and Hanska and the other cavalry. We charge. You follow us in. Then the Second and Third Cohorts of the Ironclads.” He cocked an eye at Dizala. “Right?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Dizala nodded grimly. “Right, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“All right, let’s—”</p>
<p class="para-p">Furnius pointed suddenly. “Monsters.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus turned back to look across the battlefield and for a moment had no idea what he was looking at. Suddenly he feared he was hallucinating shades from out of his nightmares. But from Dizala’s exclamation and Tahtay’s curse in the Blackfoot tongue he knew he was not alone in seeing them, and in a few moments it became clearer: a mixed force of Tlingit and Maya warriors was running up beside the Jin fire lancers in their support.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Tlingit wore fur tunics or thick double hides of caribou or elk to armor them, over hide trousers or leather leggings, and were shod in beaded moccasins. Some wore additional armor constructed of slats of cedar painted in bright patterns and bearing images of eagles and whales. They carried big wooden clubs with wicked-looking bone hooks, long double-bladed knives, bows, and a range of other Hesperian weapons. But it was their tall helmets that singled them out from other Hesperians: grotesque masks of carved wood with the faces of demons and what looked like human hair and teeth as ornamentation.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page419" title="419"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus could easily pick out the Tlingit warrior chief they had met in the southwest. He wore his demon mask with the copper eyebrows and moose hide armor fastened with toggles and bore a club studded with bone hooks.</p>
<p class="para-p">By contrast, the warriors of the Yokot’an Maya appeared gaudy and—perhaps deceptively—nowhere near as deadly. Most wore breechcloths and feathers, some only loincloths and stripes of red body paint. The better equipped among them carried shields of deerskin stretched over wooden frames painted with crude representations of great wild cats or predatory birds. Their hair was short at the sides but left long at the back and braided with bright feathers, with the front shaved to emphasize the regal slope of their foreheads. They carried clubs, spears, slings, bows.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Maya chief was easy to identify. He wore the pelt of a large spotted cat and a headdress adorned with long feathers of blue, green, and gold, and sat astride a fine Thessalian horse that must have been stolen from the Romans in a previous battle. He carried a heavy club spiked with obsidian, and his forehead, too, was slanted in the same style as the masters of the Maya longboats they had seen in the south. His ears, nose, and lips were pierced with golden plugs, and just like the chief at the Market of the Mud, he wore a necklace of heavy jade.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s first sight of the Yokot’an Maya at the Market of the Mud had been startling, and his encounter with the Tlingit chief after the Battle of Yupkoyvi had been even more unnerving, but at least he knew what he was looking at today. For most of his Romans and Cahokians, though, their appearance came as a terrible shock. The brutal depictions of human faces on the Tlingit helmets, side by side with the exotic and fearsome visages of their old enemies, the Maya, stopped the Sixth in their tracks.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Ironclads had been in battle for several hours. They had faced wave upon wave of Mongols, and many of their number had already fallen. To be confronted suddenly with a warrior force of unknown provenance was a major blow.</p>
<p class="para-p">His soldiers of Roma and Cahokia were facing an odd alliance of the ruthless warrior tribes of the Hesperian coastal northwest and the bloodthirsty civilization of the far south, all in service to a tyrannical warlord from the steppes of eastern Asia.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page420" title="420"/>
<p class="para-p">If that wasn’t a nightmare, nothing was.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Great gods,” Aurelius Dizala said, aghast, and then seemed to pull himself together. “Uh, full charge, sir?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Damned right,” Marcellinus said. “Straight down their throats.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The time for caution was long past. With the bulk of Sabinus’s Third Legion facing imminent destruction and the whereabouts of the Imperator unknown, a steady advance under shields was out of the question. They had to punch through the alliance of Jin and Mongol, Tlingit and Maya, to prevent further catastrophic losses among the Third Parthica.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked down at Tahtay. Today he saw no hesitation on the young man’s face, no uncertainty or fear. Still, he had to ask. “You’re ready for this, Tahtay?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay barely spared him a glance. “To face the men of fire? Yes. We will tear them apart.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Odd, what daunted his young friend and what didn’t. Then again, in some ways Marcellinus was the same.</p>
<p class="para-p">Of course, the Hesperians looked less alien to Tahtay than to the Romans. And Tahtay would much rather kill warriors from Asia than those from the land.</p>
<p class="para-p">At his silence, Tahtay looked up at him. “For Yupkoyvi.”</p>
<p class="para-p">A place Tahtay had never been. But surely Taianita had told him every detail of the slaughter the Mongols had perpetrated. A massacre in which the fire lances had played a gruesome part.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded. “For Yupkoyvi. And Cahokia.” For certainly neither of them wanted Jin fire lancers marching into the Great City. War chief and Praetor looked each other in the eye. Both nodded.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay hefted his long metal-studded club, of the type that already had proved so effective against the Khan’s horsemen. Its solid clout would make it a good weapon against Mongol armored infantry, too, but Marcellinus was glad he did not have to run with anything so heavy. Especially toward an enemy who could shoot a ten-foot stream of flame.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page421" title="421"/>
<p class="para-p">He wanted to say <em class="char-i">Be careful, Tahtay</em>. But those were not words one said to a warrior. “Listen for our signals. Be ready.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay nodded and sprinted back toward his warriors of Cahokia and the Blackfoot, hand-talking as best he could to Akecheta and Wahchintonka as he ran.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, no,” Aurelius Dizala said. “Holy Son of God, why?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Startled by his tribune’s tone, Marcellinus looked first at the Mongol line, which was still advancing toward the orbis of the Third Parthica. For once they were not loosing arrows, not exposing the Roman infantry square to a withering arrow storm. Such a cloud would be less effective against a well-armored square. More likely they were playing a game of intimidation, allowing fear of the fire lancers to soak into the Roman front lines in the hope that dread of the black powder weapons would do half their work for them.</p>
<p class="para-p">But now Marcellinus saw why Dizala was cursing.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, merda” was all he could manage in return.</p>
<p class="para-p">Facing the Mongols was a solid wall of the tall, curved scuta emblazoned with the blue bull of III Parthica. Interspersed here and there were several shields bearing the device of the red lion, probably held by legionaries of the 27th who had gotten displaced from their units in the heat of battle. But now Marcellinus saw oval scorpion shields belonging to the Praetorian Guard, and the tall guardsmen with the distinctive blue plumes that held them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Except that Praetorians had to be at least six feet tall and one among them was not. Marcellinus had been scanning the line for Sabinus or one of his tribunes, when his eye was arrested by this anomalous figure.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was Hadrianus, dressed in the uniform of an ordinary guardsman. He stood in the front line, coolly studying the approaching Jin fire lancers and passing orders right and left, pumping up his men. Despite his disguise, his aristocratic bearing was obvious. Surely even the Mongols must see that this was a man used to having his orders obeyed.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator had his faults, but lack of courage was not one of them.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Futete. Marcellinus? Uh, sir?” Furnius had caught sight of his Imperator and was verging on panic.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page422" title="422"/>
<p class="para-p">“Easy, soldier. I see him. Stand up straight and stop babbling.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Furnius swallowed. “Sir, yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Let’s get him out of there.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was about to lead a charge against a unified force of Mongol cavalry, Jin fire lancers, and Maya and Tlingit infantry. Behind him his troops were fraying, and in front of him his Imperator was in a ridiculously vulnerable position. Matters were speedily going from desperate to downright awful.</p>
<p class="para-p">And so he grinned a confident grin he certainly did not feel and sat up straighter in the saddle. “Then sound the horns, adjutant. Forward the Sixth Ferrata, and forward the First Cahokian!”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Even under deadly archer fire Sabinus’s men had done a creditable job of lining up in their defensive infantry squares. Their weariness was obvious, but desperation spurred them on. Bodies lay bent and broken all around them.</p>
<p class="para-p">A cohort consisted of six centuries, and so allowing for casualties, the two-cohort squares should contain about a thousand men each. That was consistent with the orbis Marcellinus saw before him now: a haphazard square 120 feet on a side, each side consisting of legionaries standing in close order three deep. The front row of men had taken a knee and held their scutum shields directly in front of them and their spears out at an angle. The second row also held outthrust spears, with the third row close behind them, its soldiers each bearing either a pilum or a bow. Each side of the square thus made a wall that bristled with sharp points.</p>
<p class="para-p">Under usual circumstances a well-formed infantry square might provide an impenetrable barrier to cavalry, turning the military action into a slow, debilitating grind. That would not be the case here. The fire lances would carve its front line into pieces, inflicting grievous burn wounds on the infantry, allowing the mounted heavy cavalrymen to penetrate the destroyed formation and cut down the remaining foot soldiers of Roma.</p>
<p class="para-p">The horses moved forward at a trot, with the soldiers of the Sixth and the warriors of Cahokia gamely doing their best to keep up. “Slow down!” Marcellinus called back. “Save your breath for the fight!”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page423" title="423"/>
<p class="para-p">As they approached the square, Marcellinus saw more. Centurions and optios passed their Imperator’s orders up and down the line and shoved foot soldiers into position with their staffs to close up the order. Perhaps brutal, but essential when everyone’s life was at risk. Signiferi stood in the front line holding their standards high, generally round silvered disks of their centuries mounted on a pole, although some were the vexillum flaglike standards of the special units. They wore small round shields over their shoulders, but their most distinctive features were the animal skins they wore on their heads: bear, lion, leopard. The signiferi were remonstrating with the tired legionaries, bucking them up and stiffening their spines, but Marcellinus guessed they also were trying to distract attention from Hadrianus. No man wanted to die knowing the dishonor of not having been able to protect his Imperator.</p>
<p class="para-p">The leader of the Mongol jaghun raised a blue flag over his head and snapped it to the left and right. In response, the Mongol light horse archers peeled off the back line and charged the Sixth as a single column. They nocked arrows even as they galloped, and soon these arrows began to fly in earnest, the foremost archers loosing missiles into the Sixth and then curving away to come around again. They would form a steady stream of fire until stopped.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Countercharge, countercharge!” Dizala shouted. Not waiting for the signal, he spurred his horse forward. Marcellinus followed, and the Ninth Syrian fell in behind them, storming into the fray.</p>
<p class="para-p">Together, the Ninth Syrian and the Cahokians were achieving their objective, which was the disruption of the Mongol attack. Meanwhile, the infantry of the Ironclads had regained their fighting spirit and were charging into the colorful mass of gold and blue and green that made up the forces of the Yokot’an Maya and Tlingit.</p>
<p class="para-p">The long line of Jin fire lancers was walking forward again with its protective rank of Mongol heavy cavalry close behind. Leather masks in front of their faces provided some protection from the fire they were about to unleash into the Third Parthica.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page424" title="424"/>
<p class="para-p">Thirty feet away from the Roman line the fire lancers halted. Centurions shouted, and some of the legionaries hurled javelins, but the Jin soldiers did not even trouble to protect themselves; the javelins bounced off their heavy armor without effect. In return the light horse archers now fired a wave of arrows into the Roman line.</p>
<p class="para-p">The arrows must have served as a signal, for at that point each Jin foot soldier grounded his fire lance in front of him. From a pot, pouch, or box at his waist each man produced a short length of what looked like burning rope. They were fuses of the type that Decinius Sabinus had termed a “slow match,” a cord impregnated with saltpeter that burned slowly and was an effective way of lighting a bomb or a lance on the battlefield. The Jin soldiers applied their slow matches to the large bulbs of black powder on their fire lances.</p>
<p class="para-p">Two hundred fire lances ignited with a roar, shooting concentrated flame a distance of ten paces in front of them. The trails of smoke that arose from them soon entwined above them into an ominous cloud.</p>
<p class="para-p">The lancers stepped forward as one, a line of fire projecting in front of them. From Yupkoyvi, Marcellinus knew their lances would burn for at least five minutes before sputtering.</p>
<p class="para-p">With perfect clarity, Marcellinus saw the Imperator Hadrianus step forward from the Roman line with his shield up. Beside him stepped a signifer of the Third, and on his other side a Praetorian centurion. As the Imperator raised his gladius, there came a second roar, this time of focused Roman rage just as powerful as the tongues of Mongol flame.</p>
<p class="para-p">The legionaries of the Third Parthica cast their pila, the iron-shanked spears flying forward in a cloud of steel of their own. And the Romans stormed forward after them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus would not wait in line to be burned. He evidently had no wish to see his orbis broken up around him, its ranks cleaved, his men slaughtered. He would meet attack with attack in an all-or-nothing surge out of the breach.</p>
<p class="para-p">And running through the horses of Marcellinus’s Sixth and streaking out ahead of them was Tahtay with his Blackfoot around him and Akecheta and the warriors of the First running behind him with spears and swords raised and nary a shield among them.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page425" title="425"/>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay’s warriors were dancing amid the Mongol horses now, and Marcellinus could scarcely bear to watch. It became a deadly game of chicken, repeated a hundred times. A Mongol warrior would bear down on a Cahokian, shooting an arrow or wielding a saber. At the very last moment the Cahokian would leap aside and bring his long club around to strike at the horse or rider. When it worked, the braves might knock a horse archer clean out of the saddle. If the Mongol’s foot caught in the stirrups, he might be dragged along by his horse; if not, he might fall to the earth, where other Cahokian warriors could converge on him and pummel him to death. When it failed, the brave would fall, his face, neck, or shoulder slashed by a saber, a spear or an arrow through his gut, or a shattered skull. The combination of fire and arrows could be deadly, but so could the combination of heavy clubs and sharp steel in Roman and Cahokian hands.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus slid off his horse again. There was no way the poor beast could cope with the unholy mix of streaking fire, smoke, noise, and bright colors. For the remainder of this battle Marcellinus once again would fight on foot. In some desperation Furnius had rearmed him. In his hands now was a contus lance, a weapon more appropriate for a mounted warrior; a Cahokian ax was slung over his shoulder, and at his waist he wore his gladius.</p>
<p class="para-p">This time, anger was not hard to come by. He was surrounded by warriors of his First Cahokian and legionaries of the Sixth. Tahtay was close by, fighting at great personal risk like a man possessed. Ahead of him were Romans in peril, among them the Imperator of Roma going blade to blade with the Mongol foe.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had fallen to a fire lancer outside Yupkoyvi. It would not happen here. He chose an enemy, raised his heavy contus, and charged forward.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Jin lancer saw Marcellinus coming and turned his deadly torrent of flame toward him. Marcellinus swung his lance around quarterstaff-style; it was a clumsy move, but the heavy wood of the contus parried the barrel of the fire lance. Hot sparks raked Marcellinus’s cheek, but he kept running forward, reversing his grip on his lance and thrusting it forward. It smashed into the Jin’s face mask and propelled the man backward. The column of fire arced into the air, and around Marcellinus came Dustu, leaping at the Jin. With the dull crack of his club, the lancer was tumbling into the dirt, his skull cracked and his neck probably broken.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page426" title="426"/>
<p class="para-p">The fire lance hit the ground, still spewing flame. Marcellinus jumped over it and chose his next Jin target.</p>
<p class="para-p">Men came to his side to fight. For a while it was Appius Gallus and three anonymous legionaries of the First. Then, as Marcellinus pulled his sword from the gut of a Mongol archer he had just dragged from his mount and stabbed, he found Dustu again to his left and Takoda to his right.</p>
<p class="para-p">Takoda wasn’t supposed to be fighting. Then again, neither was Marcellinus.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was a surreal fight. Marcellinus had no breath to speak, neither to berate nor to command. He was sucking burning air into his lungs, and every time he closed with a fire lancer, it got worse. The men around him were coughing, their eyes streaming. It was not hard to imagine they were in Hades, buried deep in the underworld, there to fight forever.</p>
<p class="para-p">The blur of combat continued. Fortunately, their foes were easy to pick out. Wearing bright feathers? A foe of the Yokot’an Maya: stab him with a gladius. A sinister helmet looming out of the smoke bearing a carved human face out of a nightmare? Cleave it with an ax.</p>
<p class="para-p">A Jin bearing a fire lance? Most definitely a foe. And now, after several minutes spent battling with Tlingit and Maya, Marcellinus was back among them. Fortunately, the fire lances were two-handed weapons; once Marcellinus had driven back the Mongol horseman who was guarding him, the Jin could only swing his weapon and try to spray him with flame. Many times Marcellinus felt the hot breath of fire scorch his flesh or beat against his breastplate with a noise as if he were being hosed down with water. Each time, he sent the Jin to hell.</p>
<p class="para-p">They got into a rhythm, now, he and Dustu and Takoda and four others of the First Cahokian who had joined them. Dustu and one of the other Cahokians would club at the Mongol cataphract in his heavy armor and try to take down either the horse or the man. Takoda and the rest would drive back any surrounding Mongols, isolating the fire lancer. Marcellinus would then assault the Jin if there was not already a legionary from the Third Parthica leaping in to do the job himself. All around them other teams of Romans and Cahokians were doing the same thing.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page427" title="427"/>
<p class="para-p">And then as Marcellinus leaped forward through the smoke, he came across Tahtay with his sash pinned and knew he could go no farther.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay was battling a fire lancer. His ten-foot sash was taut, one end attached to his waist, its other end hammered into the ground with a stake. As a Fire Heart of the Blackfoot, Tahtay could not retreat from the position he now held even if it meant his death.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus did not need to ask why Tahtay had chosen that spot to make his stand. Hadrianus was fighting just twenty feet behind him, a gladius in one hand and his shield in the other. Because of the crush of battle they could get no closer to the Imperator than that, but Takoda and Dustu came in around Marcellinus and Tahtay, along with a battered-looking foot soldier of the Third with gladius and scutum and a Praetorian with so much blood on his face and so many burns across his body that it was a wonder he could still move, let alone fight, and the six of them waged a defensive action then and there against an onslaught of a dozen more Jin fire lancers and their Mongol escorts.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had lost the heavy lance long before. He had fought with the ax for a while, but now his gladius was in his hand, his last remaining weapon. Even in the fierce melee, with his mind a haze of battle fury, Marcellinus instinctively felt the moment when the battle turned.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Jin were beginning to lose spirit. Most were on their second fire lances now, the first having coughed and died. They were backing up, away from the infantry square of the Third, and they kept stealing glances behind them as if they expected the Mongol heavies to desert them at any moment.</p>
<p class="para-p">A prescient fear, because that was exactly what the Mongol cavalry did. Marcellinus neither saw nor heard a signal, but with one accord the Mongol horsemen steered their mounts left and galloped away, leaving fifty fire lancers unsupported. Most fought on and were cut down; a dozen attempted to flee and were chased and gutted. The remainder dropped their lances and fell to their knees trying to surrender, but it was much too late for that, and they perished, too.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page428" title="428"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus pulled his gladius from the neck of a Jin warrior and blinked, his eyes stinging from the smoke. Dustu and Takoda were now to his left, and Furnius had somehow appeared on his other side, wide-eyed and bloodied. They all turned this way and that, peering into the haze for enemies.</p>
<p class="para-p">As clear thought returned, Marcellinus realized he no longer could see the Imperator and had become separated from Tahtay; he could not, in fact, even see the infantry square of the Third they had just been fighting tooth and nail to defend.</p>
<p class="para-p">The sun struggled to pierce the pall of smoke above them, its golden orb so obscured that Marcellinus could look straight at it without discomfort. And so that direction must be south or slightly west of south, and they needed it behind them if they were to walk back into the area where the Roman orbis had stood.</p>
<p class="para-p">He coughed as another wave of smoke rolled across the battlefield. Damn it. After surviving so many attacks, was it his fate to die from asphyxiation?</p>
<p class="para-p">Never had Marcellinus been on a battlefield where the air was so full of explosions and smoke. He was in no doubt: what they were witnessing today was the future of warfare. And it was terrifying.</p>
<p class="para-p">“That way,” said Furnius. “Holy Cybele…”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus’s answer was forestalled by another thick, retching cough. He merely nodded, and they walked north.</p>
<p class="para-p">The first man he saw was Akecheta with a bloody burn across his face, and then others coalesced from the hellscape around them. Here were the Cahokians, their clubs and axes bloody. Some already wore the distinctive Mongol scalps on their belts, others the feathered braids of the Maya, dripping gore onto their legs and onto the ground. Even in the thick of battle the Hesperians would have their trophies, though having seen their skill at scalping, Marcellinus knew that such trophy hunting had not slowed them down more than a few moments.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page429" title="429"/>
<p class="para-p">And here, now, were the remains of the Imperator’s Praetorian Guard, scattered among the other more conventionally armored legionaries of the First and Second Cohorts of III Parthica. Praetorians, yes, obvious by their distinctive armor and plumes, battered and burned, sooty and sweat-stained, pale shadows of the splendid figures they had cut when Marcellinus had first seen them in the Oyo Valley all those years before. The smoke was clearing now that the fire lances were all out, rising to reveal a battlefield scene out of hell.</p>
<p class="para-p">Recognizing Marcellinus, the Praetorians ushered him, Furnius, and the two Cahokians forward into a large square of smoky, sooty legionaries.</p>
<p class="para-p">And there Marcellinus found his Imperator. Praetorians knelt on either side of him, and for a long and anguished moment Marcellinus thought Hadrianus was dead. Then the Imperator turned his head an inch at a time, torturously slowly, and looked at Marcellinus.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus moved closer. Blood-darkened bandages swathed the Imperator’s midsection. His face was as pale as parchment, and he had closed his eyes again, and although his breathing was irregular and unsteady Marcellinus did not think he had lost consciousness. “Hail, Caesar.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator almost grinned, though he looked as if it pained him. “Gaius. Hail.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“He should not speak,” the Praetorian said to Marcellinus, and then leaned over Hadrianus. “You must not try to speak, Caesar.” But Hadrianus’s head lolled to one side, and now he was certainly out cold.</p>
<p class="para-p">Above them, brightly colored flying craft appeared, sending a wave of alarm across the square until they were identified as Macaw Warriors of the Hand rather than aerial warriors of the Yokot’an Maya. Marcellinus looked around him for a ranking tribune of the Third but saw only its primus pilus, weary and begrimed, exchanging notes with the Imperator’s adjutants.</p>
<p class="para-p">And now they heard the deep rumble of hooves. Horsemen were bearing down on them from the north.</p>
<p class="para-p">Takoda’s shoulders fell, and Dustu’s chin dropped to his chest as if he had suddenly fallen asleep. Both men were dirty, smoky, and ragged, their arms straight down by their sides, weapons almost slipping from their fingers. Marcellinus could not imagine they could fight anymore today.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page430" title="430"/>
<p class="para-p">“Fuck,” said Furnius, the only one of them who seemed to have retained the power of speech.</p>
<p class="para-p">However, the Praetorians were not reacting with alarm, and listening to the sound, Marcellinus nodded with relief.</p>
<p class="para-p">Moments later the Chernye Klobuki thundered in all around them, their leader’s face the picture of concern and chagrin, and Marcellinus found that he could speak after all. “Merda. Decinius Sabinus.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tied onto the horse behind the Chernye decurion was the limp body of a familiar figure, his white helmet still strapped to his head, his body a hacked-up mass of bloody wounds. Alongside rode Aelfric and a tribune of the Third, their faces grim.</p>
<p class="para-p">Praetor Decinius Sabinus had fallen in battle, just as he had predicted he would.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">As they cut Sabinus off the horse and laid him on the ground, the primus pilus of the Third came running, calling Sabinus’s name and crying out curses to the gods. Aelfric and the other tribune dismounted more quietly, their heads lowered.</p>
<p class="para-p">Suddenly, Marcellinus’s remaining strength gave out. He collapsed to the ground beside Sabinus, not in grief, for he was too drained by the combat he had just been through to feel much of anything. It was more through some kind of fellow feeling that was based on the camaraderie they had shared over the last year. A fragmented, inchoate feeling that Decinius Sabinus might be dead, but at least he did not deserve to be alone.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then he rubbed his eyes. The Imperator down, Sabinus down, and a Praetor, two tribunes, and a primus pilus all standing around in shock, saying nothing, doing nothing.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus roughly shoved himself back up onto his feet. Time to get up to date on what was going on elsewhere on this terrible battlefield.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page431" title="431"/>
<p class="para-sp">The central contingent of Mongol horsemen under the command of Subodei Badahur had fallen back in the face of repeated onslaughts from the cataphracts of the Ala I Gallorum et Pannoniorum. The damage done to the Khan’s camp by Cahokia’s Sky Lanterns and Thunderbirds earlier that day had dramatically reduced the number of remounts available to the Mongol cavalry, and they badly needed to consolidate. Meanwhile, Lucius Agrippa had managed to bring order back to his fragmented cohorts and, with the support of the Ala IV Polovtsia, had reestablished a line.</p>
<p class="para-p">The army of Jebei Noyon was already past that line, of course, but now faced a stiff counterattack. Once again the People of the Hand were fighting their own war within a war, specifically targeting Jebei and his guards to exact revenge for the destruction of Yupkoyvi.</p>
<p class="para-p">It appeared that the blood vendettas of Hesperian Mourning Wars could sometimes be useful after all.</p>
<p class="para-p">They could not expect this respite to last for long. Jebei’s forces still stood between them and Forward Camp, and the Mongol heavies might soon be back.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Juno, Tahtay…”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Cahokian war chief staggered toward him, sweaty and bloody. He bore weeping blisters from fire lance burns on both arms and had more bruises on his arms and legs than Marcellinus had ever seen before. He had a deep cut over his right eye, and a flap of skin hung loose on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="para-p">Most terrifying of all, a long gash on his leg dripped blood. The new injury was perilously close to the wound Tahtay had suffered in the Battle of Cahokia that had crippled him for so long and risked finishing him as a warrior.</p>
<p class="para-p">But Tahtay grinned. It was a ferocious grin, unhinged and unsettling. “I am fine.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You pinned your sash,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I did. And I unpinned it once we won.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page432" title="432"/>
<p class="para-p">“Tahtay…” Marcellinus gestured to where the Imperator lay surrounded by his Praetorians. “We may not be declaring victory. Not just yet.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Merda.” Tahtay’s jaw dropped.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Wanageeska?” It was Takoda. “There is something you need to see. Outside the square. Come quickly.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“Hanska.” Marcellinus felt a huge rush of relief as his centurion slid off her horse. She still lived.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Not her,” Takoda said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hanska grinned and pointed. Marcellinus followed her finger and once again feared he might be seeing things.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala sprinted across the battlefield, running on light feet and keeping her head low, almost as if she were flying very close to the ground but never quite touching it. She wore no helmet or body armor, merely a tight flying tunic and boots, her legs ridiculously bare. Her falcon mask was pushed up on her forehead like a small echo of a Tlingit war mask, and as she constantly glanced up and around her, birdlike, he glimpsed the jagged Hawk paint around her eyes. Her ax was in her hand, but she held it low, close to the ground, to avoid drawing attention to it.</p>
<p class="para-p">Yet she was hardly invisible. A Mongol horseman pulled his horse’s head around and galloped forward to ride her down. She darted sideways and looped back to evade him with that same quick alertness she displayed in the air, always with that unerring feel for space and distance and that heart-stopping flair for being on the brink of disaster. She ran on. Another Mongol horseman saw her and then another, and each time she ducked under or away from the saber or spear of the horseman without striking back and kept moving, putting Roman cavalrymen between her and her assailants as soon as she could. She never stumbled or tripped or even seemed aware of the torn-up ground and tussocks of rough grass beneath her.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was an uncanny dance, and in those moments Marcellinus loved her with a fierce ardor. It was a good job that he himself was not under attack from an enemy, for he was spellbound at her perilous looping journey across the field of war.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page433" title="433"/>
<p class="para-p">There was no point sending aid to her. Cavalry would merely alert more Mongol attackers to her presence, and besides, there wasn’t time. She would be upon them in moments.</p>
<p class="para-p">As she arrived and launched herself, he caught her and spun her around. Hanska stepped her horse forward to provide cover.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala kissed his lips and his cheeks, five hot quick kisses that set his soul on fire. He could hardly believe she was whole and in his embrace.</p>
<p class="para-p">Unarmored, she had run to his side through the battlefield. He felt an irrational flash of anger at her for risking herself, then swallowed it. Now of all times, he could not snap at her.</p>
<p class="para-p">“It’s good to see you,” he said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala raised her eyebrows at the triteness of the expression and grinned quickly. Then she jumped up off the ground and into his arms again for a rib-cracking hug. It was probably only his breastplate that saved him from serious damage.</p>
<p class="para-p">Even as she did it, Marcellinus realized she was looking over his shoulder into the east.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Why the hell did you land?” he said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I was tired of being so far above you,” she said. “I wanted to be <em class="char-i">there</em>. Meaning here. With you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He knew her better than that. “And?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala caught sight of whatever she was looking for in the skies. She nodded in satisfaction. “And the Mongol Khan is less than half a mile from where we stand. We have only minutes to get there before the skies explode around him.”</p></div></body></html>

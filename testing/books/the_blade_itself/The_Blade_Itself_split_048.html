<div id="filepos1452997" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> The Tools we Have</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta stood in the narrow hallway, leaning on his cane and waiting. On the other side of the door, he could hear raised voices.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I said, no visitors!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He sighed to himself. He had many better things to do than to stand around here on his aching leg, but he had given his word and he meant to keep it. A pokey, unremarkable hallway in a pokey, unremarkable house among many hundreds of others the same. The whole district was recently built, terraces of houses in the new fashion: half-timbered, three stories, good perhaps for a family and a couple of servants. Hundreds of houses, one very much like another. Houses for the gentlefolk. The new rich. Jumped-up commoners, Sult would probably have called them. Bankers, merchants, artisans, shop keepers, clerks. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Perhaps the odd town-house of some successful gentleman farmer, like this one here.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The voices had stopped now. Glokta heard movement, some clinking of glass, then the door opened a crack and the maid peered out. An ill-favoured girl with big, watery eyes. She looked scared and guilty. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Still, I am used to that. Everyone seems scared and guilty around the Inquisition.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“She’ll see you now,” the girl mumbled. Glokta nodded and shuffled past her into the room beyond.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He had some hazy memories of staying with West’s family for a week or two one summer, up in Angland, a dozen years ago perhaps, although it seemed more like a hundred. He remembered fencing with West in the courtyard of their house, of being watched every day by a dark-haired girl with a serious face. He remembered meeting a young woman in the park not long ago, who had asked him how he was. He had been in a lot of pain at the time, scarcely seeing straight, and her face was a blur in his memory. So it was that Glokta was not sure what to expect, but he certainly had not expected the bruises. He was a touch shocked, for a moment. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Though I hide it well.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Dark, purple and brown and yellow, under her left eye, the lower lid well swollen. Round the corner of her mouth too, the lip split and scabbed over. Glokta knew a lot about bruises, few men more. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And I hardly think she got these by accident. She was punched in the face, by someone who meant it.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He looked at those ugly marks, and he thought about his old friend Collem West, crying in his dining room and begging for help, and he put the two together.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Interesting.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She sat there, all the while, looking back at him with her chin high, the side of her face with the worst bruises turned towards him, as though challenging him to say something. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">She is not much like to her brother. Not much like at all. I don’t think she’ll be bursting into tears in my dining room, or anywhere else.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What can I do for you, Inquisitor?” she asked him coldly. He detected the very slightest slurring of the word Inquisitor. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">She has been drinking… though she hides it well. Not enough to make her stupid.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta pursed his lips. For some reason he had the feeling that he needed to watch his step.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m not here in a professional capacity. Your brother asked me to—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She cut him off rudely. “Did he? Really? Here to make sure I don’t fuck the wrong man, are you?” Glokta waited for a moment, allowing that to sink in, then he began to chuckle softly to himself. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Oh, that’s grand! I begin to quite like her!</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Something funny?” she snapped.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Pardon me,” said Glokta, wiping his running eye with a finger, “but I spent two years in the Emperor’s prisons. I daresay, if I had known I’d be there half that long at the start, I would have made a more concerted effort to kill myself. Seven hundred days, give or take, in the darkness. As close to hell, I would have thought, as a living man can go. My point is this—if you mean to upset me you’ll need more than harsh language.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta treated her to his most revolting, toothless, crazy smile. There were few people indeed who could stomach that for long, but she did not look away for an instant. Soon, in fact, she was smiling back at him. A lop-sided grin of her own, and one which he found oddly disarming. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A different tack, perhaps.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The fact is, your brother asked me to look after your welfare while he is away. As far as I’m concerned you can fuck whomever you please, though my general observation has been that, as far as the reputations of young women are concerned, the less fucking the better. The reverse is true for young men of course. Hardly fair, but then life is unfair in so many ways, this one hardly seems worth commenting on.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh. You’re right there.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good,” said Glokta, “so we understand each other then. I see that you hurt your face.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She shrugged. “I fell. I’m a clumsy fool.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I know how you feel. I’m such a fool I knocked half my teeth out and hacked my leg to useless pulp. Look at me now, a cripple. It’s amazing where a little foolishness can take you, if it goes unchecked. We clumsy types should stick together, don’t you think?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She looked at him thoughtfully for a moment, stroking the bruises on her jaw. “Yes,” she said, “I suppose we should.”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Goyle’s Practical, Vitari, was sprawled on a chair opposite Glokta, just outside the huge dark doors to the Arch Lector’s office. She was slumped into it, poured onto it, draped over it like a wet cloth, long limbs dangling, head resting on the back. Her eyes twitched lazily around the room from time to time under heavy lids, sometimes coming to rest on Glokta himself for insultingly long periods. She never turned her head though, or indeed moved a muscle, as though the effort might be too painful.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Which, indeed, it probably would be.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Plainly, she had been involved in a most violent melee, hand to hand. Above her black collar, her neck was a mass of mottled bruises. There were more around her black mask, a lot more, and a long cut across her forehead. One of her drooping hands was heavily bandaged, the knuckles of the other were scratched and scabbed over. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">She’s taken more than a couple of knocks. Fighting hard, against someone who meant business.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The tiny bell jumped and tinkled. “Inquisitor Glokta,” said the secretary, as he hurried out from behind his desk to open the door, “his Eminence will see you now.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta sighed, grunted and heaved on his cane as he got to his feet. “Good luck,” said the woman as he limped past.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She gave a barely perceptible nod towards the Arch Lector’s office. “He’s in a hell of a mood today.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">As the door opened, Sult’s voice washed out into the ante-room, changing from a muffled murmuring into an all-out scream. The secretary jerked back from the gap as if slapped in the face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Twenty Practicals!” shrieked the Arch Lector, from beyond the archway. “Twenty! We should have been questioning that bitch now, instead of sitting here, licking our wounds! How many Practicals?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Twenty, Arch Lec—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Twenty! Damn it!” Glokta took a deep breath and insinuated himself through the door. “And how many dead?” The Arch Lector was striding briskly up and down the tiled floor of his huge circular office, waving his long arms in the air. He was dressed all in white, as spotless as ever. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Though I fancy a hair is out of place, maybe even two. He must truly be in a fury.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “How many?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Seven,” mumbled Superior Goyle, hunched into his chair.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“A third of them! A third! How many injured?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Eight.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Most of the rest! Against how many?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“In all, there were six—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Really?” The Arch Lector thumped his fists on the table, leaning down over the shrinking Superior. “I heard two. Two!” he screamed, pacing once more round and round the table, “and both of them savages! Two I heard! A white one and a black one, and the black one a woman! A woman!” He kicked savagely at the chair next to Goyle and it wobbled back and forth on its feet. “And what’s worse, there were countless witnesses to this disgrace! Did I not say discreet? What part of the word discreet is beyond your comprehension, Goyle?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But Arch Lector, circumstances cannot—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Cannot?” Sult’s screech rose an entire octave higher. “Cannot? How dare you give me </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">cannot</span></span><span class="calibre3">, Goyle? Discreet I asked for, and you gave me bloody slaughter across half the Agriont, and failed into the bargain! We look like fools! Far worse, we look like weak fools! My enemies on the Closed Council will waste no time in turning this farce to their advantage. Marovia’s already stirring trouble, the old windbag, whining about liberty and tighter reins and all the rest of it! Damn lawyers! They had their way, we’d get nothing done! And you’re making it happen, Goyle! I’m stalling, and I’m saying sorry, and I’m trying to put things in the best light, but a turd’s a turd, whatever light it’s in! Do you have any notion of the damage you’ve inflicted? Of the months of hard work you’ve undone?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But, Arch Lector, have they not now left the—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They’ll be back, you cretin! He did not go to all this trouble simply to leave, dolt! Yes they’ve gone, idiot, and they’ve taken the answers with them! Who they are, what they want, who is behind them! Left? Left? Damn you, Goyle!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I am wretched, your Eminence.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You are less than wretched!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I cannot but apologise.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re lucky you’re not apologising over a slow fire!” Sult sneered his disgust. “Now get out of my sight!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Goyle flashed a look of the most profound hatred at Glokta as he cringed his way out of the room. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Goodbye, Superior Goyle, goodbye. The Arch Lector’s fury could not fall upon a more deserving candidate.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta could not suppress the tiniest of smiles as he watched him go.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Something amusing you?” Sult’s voice was ice as he held out his white gloved hand, purple stone flashing on his finger.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta bent to kiss it. “Of course not, your Eminence.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good, because you’ve nothing to be amused about, I can tell you! Keys?” he sneered. “Stories? Scrolls? What could have possessed me to listen to your drivel?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I know, Arch Lector, I apologise.” Glokta edged humbly into the chair that Goyle had so recently vacated.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You apologise, do you? Everyone apologises! Some good that does me! Fewer apologies and more successes is what I need! And to think, I had such high hopes for you! Still, I suppose we must work with the tools we have.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Meaning?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> But Glokta said nothing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We have problems. Very serious problems, in the South.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The South, Arch Lector?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Dagoska. The situation there is grave. Gurkish troops are flocking to the peninsula. They already outnumber our garrison by ten to one, and all our strength is committed in the North. Three regiments of the King’s Own remain in Adua, but with the peasants getting out of hand across half of Midderland, they cannot be spared. Superior Davoust was keeping me informed in weekly letters. He was my eyes, Glokta, do you understand? He suspected that there was a conspiracy afoot within the city. A conspiracy intending to deliver Dagoska into the hands of the Gurkish. Three weeks ago the letters stopped, and yesterday I learned that Davoust has disappeared. Disappeared! A Superior of the Inquisition! Vanished into thin air! I am blind, Glokta. I am fumbling in the dark at a most crucial time! I need someone there that I can trust, do you understand?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta’s heart was thumping. “Me?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Oh you’re learning,” sneered Sult. “You are the new Superior of Dagoska.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Me?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Many congratulations, but forgive me if we leave the feast until a quieter moment! You, Glokta, you!” The Arch Lector leaned down over him. “Go to Dagoska and dig. Find out what happened to Davoust. Weed the garden down there. Root out everything disloyal. Everything and anyone. Light a fire under them! I need to know what’s going on, if you have to toast the Lord Governor until he drips gravy!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta swallowed. “Toast the Lord Governor?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Is there an echo in here?” snarled Sult, looming even lower. “Sniff out the rot, and cut it away! Hack it off! Burn it out! All of it, wherever it is! Take charge of the city’s defences yourself if you must. You were a soldier!” He reached out and slid a single sheet of parchment across the table top. “This is the King’s writ, signed by all twelve chairs on the Closed Council. All twelve. I sweated blood to get it. Within the city of Dagoska, you will have full powers.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta stared down at the document. A simple sheet of cream-coloured paper, black writing, a huge red seal at the bottom. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">We, the undersigned, confer upon His Majesty’s faithful servant, Superior Sand dan Glokta, our full powers and authority…</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Several blocks of neat writing, and below, two columns of names. Crabby blotches, flowing swirls, near illegible scrawls. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Hoff, Sult, Marovia, Varuz, Halleck, Burr, Torlichorm, and all the rest. Powerful names.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta felt faint as he picked up the document in his two trembling hands. It seemed heavy.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Don’t let it go to your head! You still have to tread carefully. We can stand no more embarrassments, but the Gurkish must be kept out at all costs, at least until this business in Angland is settled. At all costs, do you understand?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I understand. A posting to a city surrounded by enemies and riddled with traitors, where one Superior has already mysteriously disappeared. Closer to a knife in the back than a promotion, but we must work with the tools we have.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “I understand, Arch Lector.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good. Keep me well informed. I want to be swamped by your letters.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You have two Practicals, correct?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, your Eminence, Frost and Severard, both very—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Not nearly enough! You won’t be able to trust anyone down there, not even the Inquisition.” Sult seemed to think about that for a moment. “Especially the Inquisition. I have picked out a half dozen others whose skills are proven, including Practical Vitari.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">That woman, watching over my shoulder?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “But, Arch Lector—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Don’t ‘but’ me, Glokta!” hissed Sult. “Don’t you dare ‘but’ me, not today! You’re not half as crippled as you could be! Not half as crippled, you understand?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta bowed his head. “I apologise.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You’re thinking, aren’t you? I can see the cogs turning. Thinking you don’t want one of Goyle’s people getting in the way? Well, before she worked for him she worked for me. A Styrian, from Sipano. Cold as the snow, those people, and she’s the coldest of them, I can tell you. So you needn’t worry. Not about Goyle, anyway” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">No. Only about you, which is far worse.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I will be honoured to have her along.” </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I will be damned careful.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Be as honoured as you damn well please, just don’t let me down! Make a mess of this and you’ll need more than that piece of paper to save you. A ship is waiting at the docks. Leave. Now.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course, your Eminence.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Sult turned away and strode over to the window. Glokta quietly got up, quietly slid his chair under the table, quietly shuffled across the room. The Arch Lector was still standing, hands clasped behind him, as Glokta ever so carefully pulled the doors to. It was not until they clicked shut that he realised he had been holding his breath.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“How’d it go?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta turned round sharply, his neck giving a painful click.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Strange, how I never learn not to do that.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Practical Vitari was still flopped in her chair, looking up at him with tired eyes. She did not seem to have moved the whole time he was inside. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">How did it go?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He ran his tongue around his mouth, over his empty gums, thinking about it. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">That remains to be seen.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Interesting,” he said in the end. “I am going to Dagoska.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“So I hear.” The woman did indeed have an accent, now he thought about it. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A slight whiff of the Free Cities.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I understand you’re coming with me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I understand I am.” But she did not move.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We are in something of a hurry.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I know.” She held out her hand. “Could you help me up?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta raised his eyebrows. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I wonder when I was last asked that question?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He had half a mind to say no, but in the end he held his hand out, if only for the novelty. Her fingers closed round it, started to pull. Her eyes were narrowed, he could hear her breath hissing as she unfolded herself slowly from the chair. It hurt, having her pull on him like that, in his arm, in his back. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But it hurts her more.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Behind her mask, he was pretty sure, her teeth were gritted with pain. She moved her limbs one at a time, cautiously, not sure what would hurt and how much. Glokta had to smile. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A routine I go through myself every morning. Strangely invigorating, to see someone else doing it.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Eventually she was standing, her bandaged hand clutched against her ribs. “You able to walk?” asked Glokta.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’ll loosen up.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What happened? Dogs?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She gave a bark of laughter. “No. A big Northman knocked the shit out of me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta snorted. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Well, forthright at least.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> “Shall we go?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">She looked down at his cane. “Don’t suppose you’ve got one of those spare, have you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I’m afraid not. I only have the one, and I can’t walk without it.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I know how you feel.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Not quite.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta turned and began to limp away from the Arch Lector’s office. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Not quite.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He could hear the woman hobbling along behind. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Strangely invigorating to have someone trying to keep up with me.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He upped the pace, and it hurt him. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But it hurts her more.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Back to the South, then.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He licked at his empty gums. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Hardly a place of happy memories. To fight the Gurkish, after what it cost me last time. To root out disloyalty in a city where no one can be trusted, especially those sent to help me. To struggle in the heat and the dust, at a thankless task almost certain to end in failure. And failure, more than likely, will mean death.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He felt his cheek twitch, his eyelid flicker. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">At the hands of the Gurkish? At the hands of plotters against the crown? At the hands of his Eminence, or his agents? Or simply to vanish, as my predecessor did? Has one man ever had such a range of deaths to choose from?</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The corner of his mouth twitched up. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">I can hardly wait to get started.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">That same question came into his head, over and over, and he still had no answer.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Why do I do this?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Why?</span></span></p><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_48"></div></div></body>

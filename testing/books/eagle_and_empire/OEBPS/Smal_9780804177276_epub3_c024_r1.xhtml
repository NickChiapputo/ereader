<p class="para-pf" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">T</span>he delay was not all bad. The hiatus gave the wounded time to heal. Marcellinus led small groups of his infantry on limited but useful exercises. He tried to apologize to Tahtay, who curtly pushed the matter aside and refused to discuss it. Either the war chief was embarrassed at his failure of nerve or Kimimela and Enopay had helped smooth things over behind the scenes. They had not returned to their former friendship, though. Tahtay continued to be brusque with him, and their conversations did not stray beyond logistical issues.</p>
<p class="para-p">While waiting for the mud to dry, both sides continued to send out patrols and skirmishing forces to guard against the twin possibilities of deception and surprise. Both kept the size of those patrols down to a few troopers. The opposing patrols largely passed one another in silence and did not engage. The Cahokian Hawks were permitted to approach almost to the edge of the Mongol camp before being chased away by Firebirds, and the Romans allowed the Mongol aerial craft almost the same latitude. There must be order in war, there must be scouting and careful surveillance, and the leaders of both sides understood that.</p>
<p class="para-p">Chinggis Khan had a reputation for deception, cunning ambushes, and surprise assaults, but even with meticulous patrolling the Romans detected none. The continuing concern, of course, was that the Mongols would send a covert force to attack them from the rear. But with Sintikala’s Hawks constantly in the air and additional surveillance from Eagles and Sky Lanterns, the chances of such a surprise succeeding were greatly reduced.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page388" title="388"/>
<p class="para-p">Instead, the Mongols devoted their energies to merging their camps. Both aerial and ground reconnaissance revealed that mingghans from Chagatai’s camp were being steadily transferred to swell the ranks at Chinggis’s. By nightfall on the third day Chagatai’s campsite was abandoned, leaving only a large discolored scar on the prairie.</p>
<p class="para-p">That night the Mongols held quite the celebration in their newly merged camp. The roar was audible at Forward Camp. Roma’s rank and file had come to war without wine, but their enemies had clearly made the time to distill airag. From the din and the drumming, it appeared that the Mongols were quite happy with how their war against Roma was proceeding.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Horde did not, however, let down its guard. Sintikala reported that a fourth of the Khan’s army kept a steady and presumably sober guard, day and night. Just like the Romans, the Mongols were taking all due care to avoid surprise attacks.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">“And so, gentlemen, we face battle again on the morrow. Your thoughts?”</p>
<p class="para-p">They lay on couches in the Imperator’s Praetorium tent, each propped up on his elbow in the Roman style: Hadrianus, who had just spoken, still nibbling on a leg of roasted duck; Decinius Sabinus, who lay as stiff as if he were made of wood but who had put away much more food and drink than Marcellinus might have expected; Lucius Agrippa, lolling more like an aesthete than a soldier in his tunic and sagum cloak; and finally Marcellinus and Tahtay, both visibly awkward and uncomfortable. Tahtay wore a Cahokian tunic but Roman military sandals, which fit his feet better and allowed him to run a great deal faster. His clothes and long hair emphasized his difference from the men around him.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Kill them all,” Agrippa said. “Let them come. Let them be bombed by liquid fire. Once we can persuade the Cahokians to risk their precious Thunderbirds, that is.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page389" title="389"/>
<p class="para-p">Decinius Sabinus reached for the bowl of askutasquash, then changed his mind and plucked out another of what might have been honeyed stuffed dormice if they had been in Roma but here was presumably some kind of vole. Tahtay had reacted with subdued horror on first seeing the dish, and Marcellinus was happy to follow the war chief’s lead and stick to more recognizable fare, but Sabinus seemed quite the connoisseur of the small rodents. It had to be said that the Imperator’s chefs were doing their best with the limited resources available.</p>
<p class="para-p">As Sabinus was obviously avoiding the question, Marcellinus grasped the nettle. “I for one do not think we should merely <em class="char-i">let them come.</em>”</p>
<p class="para-p">Agrippa shook his head. Admonished by Hadrianus on one too many occasions for picking fights with Marcellinus over military topics, he had become more circumspect with his disdain.</p>
<p class="para-p">His mouth full, Hadrianus waved his beaker of wine at Marcellinus to continue.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus bowed his head respectfully. “Many years ago the Iroqua defeated Cahokia in battle. They did so by being more energetic, inventive, and innovative than we anticipated.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay eyed him, stony-faced. Marcellinus glanced back at him in mute apology. “Here again we face a resourceful enemy. One who adjusts his tactics according to the needs of the day. An enemy that does not fear to try new things.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus took a gulp of his water. “And so, if the Mongols are innovative, we must be more so. If they are cunning, we must outwit them. If the Mongols throw caution to the winds, then Roma must already be…sailing on those winds.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“A poet as well as a sage,” said Agrippa.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus grinned. “One tries.” He turned serious again. “Caesar, we have already taken more losses on the battlefield than I am comfortable with. I am sure that you, too, are disconcerted by them.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus inclined his head. “I regret the loss of every legionary under my command.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Just so, just so.” Marcellinus paused. He was picking up the Imperator’s verbal tics. He should stop that lest he be accused of mockery. “Anyway. We have suffered losses because we expected the Khan that we met on the plains of Asia a decade ago. This is not that Khan. This is a Khan who has learned much from the Jin in the meantime and even more from the Tlingit and Haida of the northwest with their Fishing Eagle craft that he has turned into Firebirds. As a result he has flying machines, black powder bombs, fire lances, siege engines, rockets. He may have even more tricks up his sleeve. If you remain the same army he met in Asia, you risk even greater losses.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page390" title="390"/>
<p class="para-p">“ ‘We,’ ” Lucius Agrippa said pointedly.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus had switched from “we” to “you” in midstream. He quickly conceded the point. “We, indeed.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We came to Cahokia for Greek fire,” the Imperator objected. “And for flight. And now we have them.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And we will use those things, but the Mongol Khan will expect them. We must work harder to outsmart him. Much harder.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And so you suggest what, exactly?” Agrippa demanded.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus smiled, refusing to be rattled. “Then you agree that the Mongol Khan has learned from the best? And that we must do the same?”</p>
<p class="para-p">He told them what he had in mind. Tahtay’s eyes widened. Marcellinus’s fellow Praetors frowned and bombarded him with questions and objections. Unable to lie almost supine under such interrogation, Marcellinus stood to answer them.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus remained aloof from the discussion. He appeared lost in thought, ignoring the debate, but Marcellinus knew he was listening to every word.</p>
<p class="para-p">Eventually Sabinus and Agrippa ran out of questions. Tahtay now sat upright with his knees up to his chest, a position that made him look less like an overburdened war chief and more like the spirited youth he used to be. His perpetual frown was gone, and his visage was clearer than it had been for many days.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sabinus looked at him dourly. “One of us, at least, finds virtue in your plan.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of course,” Tahtay said.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page391" title="391"/>
<p class="para-p">“Then you’re as mad as he is.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That’s a matter of degree, I think.” Marcellinus eased himself down.</p>
<p class="para-p">“We cannot possibly place the Imperator at such risk,” Sabinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus grunted and spoke for the first time in a while. “I think the Imperator might be the person best placed to make that call.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sabinus shook his head, but when Hadrianus skewered him with a look, he said, “Yes, Caesar.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Lucius Agrippa,” the Imperator said, “in your early acquaintance with Gaius Marcellinus, you accused him of having few strategic skills.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus remembered the moment vividly. He pursed his lips and did his best to mimic Agrippa’s sneering tone that day. “ ‘Strong on tactics. Weak on strategy. Not a general of long-term vision.’ Do you still hold this view?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I do,” Agrippa said. “Although we might quibble about where strategy leaves off and tactics begin.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“A poet to the left of me, a philosopher to the right.” Hadrianus grinned. “We will proceed as Gaius suggests, with a few significant changes.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Agrippa and Sabinus both swiveled to stare at him. “Just like that?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, just like that.” Hadrianus continued to speak, laying out his version of Marcellinus’s original ideas.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus found himself nodding almost continuously. The Imperator had a keen tactical brain himself, and he knew his legions and alae well. “Yes, Caesar. Much better, your view of things.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“My thanks, Gaius Marcellinus,” said the ruler of the known world a little drily.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I still protest,” Sabinus said. “And I must have that known.”</p>
<p class="para-p">As well he might. On many previous occasions Marcellinus had aligned himself with Sabinus, and the two men had stood together. Today they did not, and the plan proposed by Marcellinus and his Imperator put the cream of Sabinus’s forces at risk.</p>
<p class="para-p">“So noted, Decinius Sabinus, but by all means, try to look a <em class="char-i">little</em> cheerful.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It is a plan with many merits,” said Agrippa, who had visibly begun warming to the ideas once they started to come out of his Imperator’s mouth rather than Marcellinus’s.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page392" title="392"/>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus drained his beaker and got to his feet. A new restless light shone in his eyes. At long last he appeared to be enjoying himself. “Well, well. You may be earning your keep at last, Gaius Marcellinus. Indeed, I am fast approaching the point where I will no longer regret staying your execution.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus paused. Even now, his Imperator’s sense of humor could be alarming. “Thank you, Caesar.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps you should wait to see how this turns out before reaching such a bold conclusion,” Sabinus said sourly.</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus raised his eyebrows and threw his cloak over his shoulders. “So cautious all of a sudden, gentlemen. It does not suit you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The meeting broke up, and the Praetors and Tahtay dispersed to brief their various tribunes, adjutants, elders, and lieutenants. Marcellinus found himself walking along the Cardo with Sabinus, who glanced back and then said: “One thing we can be sure of. One way or the other, at least this accursed war will be quickly over.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Strength, Decinius Sabinus,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sabinus did not smile. “The Imperator has an impetuous streak. So does Agrippa. You play to them both.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That does not make the plan a poor one.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It places the Imperator at risk.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“The men need to know that Hadrianus is with them, taking the same risks, advancing as far from safety as they do. When he commits himself to the endeavor, so will they. And he will, of course, be surrounded by thousands of legionaries. He would be at worse risk here in camp if the Mongols were to flank us.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“But in addition, the plan also throws to the winds many of our key advantages.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And in the process gains us other advantages that are even more critical. Including that of surprise.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We shall see, sir.” Sabinus gave him a curt nod as they parted company. “Indeed, we shall see.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page393" title="393"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus continued on his way toward the Southgate out of the inner castra, still mulling things over. For all his confidence in the war council, there was still much to coordinate and even more that could go wrong.</p>
<p class="para-p">And if Sabinus and Agrippa were so dubious about the plan, Marcellinus could hardly wait to hear how Sintikala, Chenoa, and Pahin would receive it. He might be in for a long night.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">The armies of Roma and Cahokia took the field of battle very early the next morning. Rather than funnel out through the Westgate of Forward Camp as they had done before, they ripped apart the castra walls and dragged aside the fence around the wider encampment before dawn, then marched out across the earthworks and through the ditch. A full-strength legion marching six abreast created a column well over a mile long, and channeling men into such a column required laborious logistic control by the tribunes and centurions. Today they had no time for that.</p>
<p class="para-p">The legions were led from the camp by Imperator Hadrianus III himself, riding his splendid Nisaean horse and surrounded by gleaming Praetorian Guards. Hadrianus would not ride into combat at their head, of course—it had been more than a thousand years since a Roman Imperator had put himself in extremis like that—but it was a fine thing for his men to see him taking the lead. The cheers reverberated through the camp, and Marcellinus hoped they would be heard far across the plains.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus led the Legio VI Ferrata out of the camp immediately following the Praetorians. He felt a little absurd parading out on his high horse with his polished armor and gleaming white-crested helmet, but he was loudly cheered all the same. His adjutants Aulus and Furnius rode to his left, their chests puffed out farther than usual, and Takoda and Napayshni were to his right; Enopay and Sollonius would stay in the rear to begin with, to coordinate with the engineers and associated centuries that would follow in their wake.</p>
<p class="para-p">Today the Sixth Ferrata would be an integrated force of Romans and Hesperians. Marcellinus was done with banishing his Cahokian friends to the wings of his legion. The First Cahokian marched out amid the Sixth Legion, between its Third and Fourth Cohorts, many of them carrying the same scutum shields with their golden lightning-bolt crest. Hanska and her combined Second and Third Cahokian rode out with the mounted Ninth Syrian Cohort. He was almost painfully aware that Sintikala and Kimimela were aboard two of the Hawks that circled overhead, but he restrained himself from peering up and kept his chin level and his gaze forward.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page394" title="394"/>
<p class="para-p">After the Sixth would come the engineers and legionaries in charge of the launch towers, half a dozen of which had been dismantled and loaded into mule-drawn wagons overnight. Next would come the Polovtsians and the other cavalry wings. Once clear of the camp the horsemen would ride past the infantry and fan out into a broad escort and advance guard. The Third and 27th Legions would be taking the field at the same time, marching out of camp to the north and then swinging around to join them.</p>
<p class="para-p">The foot soldiers of the Sixth Legion did not march in the triple lines they would assume in battle. Marcellinus’s men walked in broad, loose columns, cohort by cohort and century by century. This was not a drill, and there was no need to maintain an onerous formation over a walk of many miles. Plenty of time to fall into ranks once combat was imminent.</p>
<p class="para-p">As the three legions and associated cavalry proceeded into the Grass, the horsemen of the Praetorians guided them into place with the help of scouts and dispatch riders, standard-bearers and trumpeters. Marcellinus and the other Praetors and tribunes passed orders down through their ranks to the individual centuries to adjust their paths. Gradually the three legions moved into a line that extended across many miles of prairie. It might be impossible to keep this line straight across such a distance and over such varied terrain, but it was a credible effort nonetheless. This was Imperial Roma on the move, a well-oiled machine.</p>
<p class="para-p">By the time they were two miles from Forward Camp, they had completed their reorganization, with the Third Parthica assuming the central position, flanked by the Ironclads on the left and the 27th on the right.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page395" title="395"/>
<p class="para-p">It was still early in the morning when they first saw arbans of Mongol skirmishers, light unarmored cavalry riding in groups of ten. As soon as the Mongol riders came in sight, squadrons of the Third Polovtsian cantered forward to push them back.</p>
<p class="para-p">Roma had its own advance riders, of course. Norse scouts trotted ahead of the legions, along with a few turmae of the Fourth Gallorum, checking for ambushes and other traps and watching for the approach of the Mongol army.</p>
<p class="para-p">After a while Marcellinus and his adjutants dismounted and walked to keep their horses fresh and stretch their own legs. Behind them in the ranks men chatted, gossiped, bragged; their centurions had little reason to keep them quiet when they were in such good spirits. It was this camaraderie that made men an army rather than a crowd, and the officers would have been foolish to damp it down. Come the fight, those bonds would be critical. A hundred yards to the right even Appius Gallus was, if not exactly smiling, at least engaged in a spirited and friendly conversation with the nearest foot soldiers.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was receiving intelligence and information from his scouts as they proceeded. Signals from above and written messages from the sides as the Hawks, scouts, and mounted dispatch riders moved back and forth across the face of the great army, relaying logistic details. From time to time Marcellinus ordered a roll call by trumpet signal, cohort by cohort, but it was largely make-work and pageantry; he could see most of them anyway, and their tribunes or First Centurions would signal him if they encountered any difficulties. Above him Hawks, Eagles, and Macaws were scouting forward as well and would provide plenty of notice of any encroaching Mongol forces larger than a couple of dozen skirmishers.</p>
<p class="para-p">Despite riding in the vanguard of a mighty army of tens of thousands of soldiers or perhaps because of it, Marcellinus once again felt strangely alone. Alongside, behind, and even above him was almost every friend he possessed: Tahtay, Kimimela, and Enopay; Sintikala and Chenoa; Aelfric and Isleifur; Hanska and Taianita. None were within earshot at the moment.</p>
<p class="para-p">He would have given a lot to have Kimimela riding beside him today. Perhaps he should have suggested that. She could easily have dropped back to one of the field launchers once the Mongols appeared. But it would have been an indulgence.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page396" title="396"/>
<p class="para-p">In the meantime, it was a beautiful day on the prairies, and as a result of the cooling effect of the rains it wasn’t too sultry for a change. Marcellinus became absorbed by the clouds, the birds on the wing, the tussocks of grass and small bushes on the ground around him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Toward the end of the second hour Marcellinus spied Isleifur Bjarnason and Einar Stenberg ahead of them. As before, they had marked the halfway point between the camps of the Imperator and the Mongol Khan. The legions passed that point and kept going. Marcellinus grinned and saluted them, and they fell in to ride behind him, Stenberg to his left and Bjarnason to his right.</p>
<p class="para-p">By then the Imperator had dropped back to ride behind the Third, still surrounded by his Praetorians. During the coming battle Hadrianus’s position would be the hub of information, but he would be free to move in a crisis as circumstances warranted.</p>
<p class="para-p">Glancing back, Marcellinus saw congestion in the ranks. Two nearby rises in the terrain had forced several centuries closer together, and they were impeding one another. Men were swearing good-naturedly. Marcellinus left them to it. The centurions would sort it out.</p>
<p class="para-p">Another small group of Mongol skirmishers from Chinggis’s army cantered over the plains toward them, loosed arrows, then turned and galloped away. None of the arrows struck home, and a round of laughter and cheerful profanity chased the enemy horsemen back across the plains.</p>
<p class="para-p">You never could tell with armies. Sometimes they were somber and bloody-minded before battle, and then the very next day the same legion could display a devil-may-care braggadocio. In this case the hiatus had done the men good: that and their current confident and somewhat audacious march into enemy territory.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus hoped that confidence would translate into them fighting like demons in what? An hour? Less?</p>
<p class="para-p">“Mongols,” Aulus said suddenly. “Here we go.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page397" title="397"/>
<p class="para-p">His adjutant hardly needed to point. Marcellinus had been aware of the rising level of the naccara drums in the distance for some time, and ten minutes earlier Sintikala had begun to weave back and forth above him in a pattern that he had no difficulty interpreting. As they came over a small rise, the enemy was evident: a line of Mongol horsemen in the middle distance. They were so close to the giant, sprawling Mongol encampment that they could see its smoke and smell it on the winds, similar to the reek of Forward Camp but also, in many ways, very different. They were surely within range of the Mongol aerial craft, but as yet they saw none.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now came a long trumpet blast from the central point of the Third Parthica far to the north, bringing the legions to order. Marcellinus nodded to his cornicen, who echoed the signal along the massed line of the Sixth Ferrata. Centurions bellowed, and their men began to move into position, standing taller even as they continued their advance.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Ala II Hispanorum Aravacorum came forward, passing between the Sixth Ferrata and the Third Parthica. They wheeled left, riding in a double column to cover and protect the front line of the Sixth. To the right the Third Polovtsians were doing the same for the Third Parthica, providing security as the men maneuvered. And by all appearances it was as well that they had such cover, for the infantry was taking its time getting into position.</p>
<p class="para-p">Three-quarters of a mile ahead the Mongol lines were beginning to form. The sun from over Marcellinus’s left shoulder glistened off the steel lamellar armor worn by the warriors and horses of the heavies in a very different way than it did from the hide armor of the light horse archers.</p>
<p class="para-p">To Marcellinus’s eye it seemed that the Mongols were forming lines in considerable haste. By virtue of the Romans’ rapid and early deployment into the field and by continuing their march to within sight of the Mongol camp, they had caught the Khan’s army by surprise, forcing them to hurry their formations.</p>
<p class="para-p">That had been, of course, precisely Marcellinus’s intent when he had proposed this strategy.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page398" title="398"/>
<p class="para-p">This time it was the legions whose movements seemed calm and almost casual as they ambled together into close order.</p>
<p class="para-p">And thus the Sixth had not yet completed its transition into triplex acies when the Second Aravacorum charged the Mongols’ right flank.</p>
<p class="para-p">The heavy horsemen of the Ala I Gallorum et Pannoniorum Cataphractaria broke out and followed. The two Polovtsian cavalry wings surged out after them, and in their wake the smaller mounted units of the Fourth Gallorum, the Ninth Syrian, and the Second and Third Cahokian. All of a sudden the massed cavalry of all three legions was pouring through the ranks of the Roman infantry and across the plains toward the Mongol army. In their charge they closed into a rough echelon, which was about the best they could do; Roman squadrons in such numbers could not maintain the type of close formation that the Mongols could achieve.</p>
<p class="para-p">None of the Roman cohorts were fully deployed when the combined alae thundered into the field. It looked like an impetuous action, even a mistake. It was not.</p>
<p class="para-p">The right flank of Mongol armies—of all Asian steppe armies, in fact—was sacred. Traditionally, most major Mongol offensives came from the right. The Khan would often put his most trusted general in charge of the right wing. In attacking that wing Roma was going for the jugular straightaway, first thing.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus and his Imperator were done with being passive defenders, inviting the waves of Mongol aggression to crash against the rock of their legions. No longer would they wait for the Mongol Horde to come to them. The best form of defense was attack, and today the forces of Roma and Hesperia would do all they could to wrong-foot their opponents. They would regain the initiative and, with luck, keep it for the rest of the war.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus watched the Ala II Hispanorum Aravacorum ride into battle with something like wistfulness. Gods knew he was no horseman, but the assault of the combined alae was a magnificent sight to behold. Just for a moment he would have loved to be a part of that massive charge straight into the enemy.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page399" title="399"/>
<p class="para-p">And even now, the Mongols were still scurrying to get into position.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Forward!” Marcellinus roared, raising his gladius high over his head and using his knees to start his horse walking again. Behind him, trumpets sounded and centurions relayed their orders. The Sixth Ferrata advanced, shields up and pila at the ready.</p>
<p class="para-p">Once they were in motion, Marcellinus gave his second order, this time to Takoda, who twisted in the saddle to make wide gestures in the warrior sign language. Hesperians ran through the ranks and out in front of the steadily advancing legionaries; among them Marcellinus could pick out Cahokians, Blackfoot, Mohawk, Huron, Onondaga, Cherokee, and People of the Hand. None of those braves of the Hesperian League wore armor beyond the traditional wooden or reed mat chest protection, and none carried Roman weapons or shields, having left them at the rear of the formation. Today the Hesperians would fight with their own weapons. Some had bows slung over their shoulders, others carried light spears, but most were armed with long clubs, slings, or larger versions of Marcellinus’s new slingshots. Ahead of them all sprinted Tahtay, with Dustu to his left and a Blackfoot warrior whose name Marcellinus had forgotten to his right. They darted like gazelles, jumping over grassy tussocks and rocks that might have tripped lesser men, and Marcellinus knew they could keep that up all day.</p>
<p class="para-p">The first lines of Roman foot soldiers accelerated their pace in a forlorn attempt to keep up with the Hesperian League. Their centurions snapped at them, and they desisted. Legionaries were strong fighters and men of enviable stamina, but they could hardly run in armor for another mile and hope to fight a battle at the end of it. Their turn would come. But not yet.</p>
<p class="para-p">By then the Second Aravacorum was almost upon the Mongols. They had quickly raised their initial trot to a canter and were coming up to full speed. Behind them, the cataphracts in their heavy armor were at the most ponderous of gallops, their twelve-foot contus lances couched under their arms, ready for impact.</p>
<p class="para-p">Around the heavies spilled the two Polovtsian alae, loosing arrows at the Mongol line. For now, their lances were still holstered in the leather holders that hung from their saddles, although they would surely snatch them out soon. Behind came the cohortes equitatae. Moving considerably faster than the cataphracts and beginning to pass them but not as good at shooting arrows from the gallop, those cavalrymen had already drawn their long spatha swords.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page400" title="400"/>
<p class="para-p">The Roman cavalry plowed into the Mongol line. The heavies crashed through, unseating many a Mongol. The Polovtsians wheeled, continuing to shoot arrows from a distance, but the Second Aravacorum and the Ninth Syrian were already into the melee, hacking at the Mongol horsemen with a will.</p>
<p class="para-p">Within moments the Mongol line was completely disrupted. Having barreled through, the Roman heavies were all set to smash into the second line next. Two hundred yards beyond that the Mongol heavy cavalry was coming together at last, shoulder to shoulder and stirrup to stirrup, preparing their countercharge.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus relinquished his place at the head of the Sixth to Aurelius Dizala and rode to the right, still flanked by his adjutants. Reaching his First Cohort, he snapped a salute to Appius Gallus and peered north.</p>
<p class="para-p">The infantry maneuvers appeared to be going as planned. The Third Parthica was hanging back, and beyond them the 27th Augustan was matching the Sixth in advancing smartly, their neatly arrayed shields a vivid swath of red. The huge Roman infantry line was bending, with the wings coming forward to form two horns out ahead of the Third.</p>
<p class="para-p">The Mongol generals would realize that the Romans were attempting to envelop them and push them back against their own camp. No one, least of all Marcellinus or the Imperator, expected this gambit to succeed. The Mongols were agile and quick-thinking; they would counterattack, and soon, but at least the curved Roman formation would bring the enemy under fire more quickly and prevent them from executing the broad assaults that had formed the core of their strategy in the first battle.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay was running forward from the rear of the Sixth. Marcellinus really should have expended the time to teach the boy to ride.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Trebuchets,” Enopay panted as he arrived. “Grouped together into three clumps and defended by simple wooden field fortifications. Far left, far right, center. If we keep moving forward, we’ll be in range of them.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page401" title="401"/>
<p class="para-p">“Grouped? Tell Chenoa.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sintikala signaled me, so Chenoa already knows.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus couldn’t yet see the trebuchets. The terrain here was more creased than he would like, and his men were blocking his view. He snapped his fingers to hurry the boy up. “Come on, Enopay. Distance and direction?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay pointed. “The nearest cluster is a quarter mile.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The human-powered Jin trebuchets had a range of just a few hundred feet, less than half that of the Roman and Cahokian throwing engines, when firing the larger metal-encased thunder crash bombs. Much farther for the lighter thunderclap bombs that were wrapped in paper or deerskin. The trebuchets would provide a last-ditch defense of the Mongol camp.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Chenoa will target them from the air?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes,” Enopay said. “So don’t get too close to them yet.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus devoutly hoped the Mongol trebuchets weren’t crewed by Hesperian prisoners, because Chenoa could not hesitate: she would bomb them with liquid flame as soon as she could safely get her Thunderbirds to them. Nothing Marcellinus could do about it this time. “And what do the scouts say?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“That the Imperator is now up behind the Third, surrounded by his Praetorians. The Chernye Klobuki will remain in reserve with him for now. No canoes moving nearby on the rivers. No Mongol attempts at flanking us. Oh, and Subodei Badahur has been sighted in the central block of the Mongol army, and Jebei Noyon holds their left wing as before, which means that on this wing you face Chagatai again.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Polovtsians had wheeled around and charged again into the Mongol lines, and now Marcellinus glimpsed Hanska’s Third Cahokian Cohort similarly riding out from the mass of Mongols and arcing around to strike back into the line.</p>
<p class="para-p">Ahead of her was the Second Aravacorum. He hoped Hanska would latch on to them and that they would all ride out together, as ordered. If they got cut off from the rest of the alae deep within the Mongol cavalry…</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page402" title="402"/>
<p class="para-p">“She will be all right,” Enopay said. “She is unkillable.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“She’d better be,” Marcellinus said, switching to Cahokian. “When you’re able, tell me where Kimimela and Sintikala are.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sir, yes, sir,” Enopay responded in Latin.</p>
<p class="para-p">Aulus called to him. “Signal from Aelfric. Permission to assault the leftmost battery of trebuchets with the Sixth Cohort?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Yes, even Marcellinus could see the trebuchets now. “Tell him to wait for the air attack. Chenoa gets the first strike. Once the Thunderbirds pass, Aelfric can go ahead and mount his ground attack without further confirmation from me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">A trumpet blared. “Mongols charging,” Enopay said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus nodded. “Aulus, halt the advance; hold the line here.” The cornicen was within earshot, and so the signal came almost immediately; Enopay put his hand up to his ear to block the clamor.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sure enough, they were coming full on, a column of Mongol light cavalry thundering toward Marcellinus’s First Cohort and already nocking arrows to fire in caracole. It looked like the Romans’ initial advantage was over.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Come on, sir,” Aulus said. Enopay, the only adjutant with no horse, was already running back to safety at the rear of the First. “Sir?”</p>
<p class="para-p">A second cornu sounded, and Marcellinus’s front line raised shields. Marcellinus and his adjutants made haste, riding back through the ranks to take their place behind the First Cohort. There they found Sollonius, who looked relieved to see Marcellinus following common sense for once.</p>
<p class="para-p">Mongol arrows began to rain upon his line, but Marcellinus was watching the Roman cavalry. Having wrought their havoc, the Second Aravacorum was falling into a sleek column and riding back toward the left-hand end of the Sixth. The two Polovtsian alae were all mixed up together as usual, but once they got themselves sorted out, the Third Polovtsia would move to join Sabinus’s legion while the Fourth hightailed it across the field to support Agrippa’s 27th Augustan.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page403" title="403"/>
<p class="para-p">For a few dire moments Marcellinus saw nothing else and began to worry. Then the heavily armored horses of the Ala I Cataphractaria exploded out of the Mongol line in much more of an organized formation than he might have expected; on either side of them were the light horsemen of the Ninth Syrian and Hanska’s Third, jumbled together almost as badly as the Polovtsians. And yes, there was Hanska herself, raised up out of the saddle and waving a bloody spatha over her head. Probably screeching her bloodcurdling battle scream and scaring the crap out of everyone around her.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Told you,” Enopay said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, adjutant, thank you,” Marcellinus said, and winked at him.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Ten minutes later they were in a pitched battle. Almost as soon as the allied cavalrymen cleared the Mongol line, the Horde was on the move, charging out in pursuit. Chagatai might have hoped to run down the stragglers, or perhaps thought that the withdrawing horsemen would disrupt the Roman line. Neither happened. The Roman and Cahokian cavalry were already well clear and cantered safely back through the gaps between the infantry cohorts of the Sixth Ferrata, which then closed up behind them. This left only moments for the Fifth through Seventh Cohorts to step forward into position and create an unbroken line of Roman steel, but all those drills out on the west bank of the Mizipi were paying off now.</p>
<p class="para-p">Through his discussions with Gallus, Sabinus, and Agrippa, Marcellinus had become familiar with the Mongol names for their various formations. Their formation from the first day, with broad rows of horsemen attacking in waves, was known as the Lake Formation. Today he was enjoying the dubious honor of seeing two different formations attacking his legion at the same time. The first was Moving Bush, in which independent squads of light horse archers assaulted almost randomly from different directions, each pummeling a small section of his line with great ferocity and then breaking away. The second was the more deadly Chisel Formation, similar to the Roman cuneus: a narrow but deep squadron of fully armored heavy cavalry that came at full charge and slammed obliquely into the front of his First Cohort with such ferocity that Marcellinus half expected sparks to fly and the grass around them to catch fire. In principle, the Chisel allowed his men to attack the Mongol flanks. In practice, the heavy horsemen at a gallop were moving too fast for infantry to assail them effectively.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page404" title="404"/>
<p class="para-p">The nice theory was that horsemen could never break a determined infantry position. The truth of it was that the Mongols’ horses were trained to be almost as dangerous as their warriors, and it would take a stout Roman cohort indeed to resist the combination of biting, kicking horses and the long hooked spears and sabers of their riders. In the face of such concerted and focused battering, the most that Marcellinus could hope was that his line would only bend, not break, and would reestablish itself promptly once the Mongol heavies were beaten back.</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay and the others were, however, having much better success with the light cavalry. It turned out that an athletic Cahokian, Blackfoot, or Iroqua warrior with a long club was quite as nimble as a Mongol horse archer, if not as fast. A well-aimed blow with the club could cause substantial injury to a horse’s legs or chest. An even better-aimed blow could knock the rider right out of the saddle to either sprawl painfully across his horse or tumble off onto the ground.</p>
<p class="para-p">All this simultaneous activity had the odd consequence that at any given moment some sections of Marcellinus’s line would be hooting and laughing and mocking fallen Mongols or leaping forward to spear to death enemies who had been knocked to the ground, even as other sections were locked together in furious combat with heavily armored adversaries and grimly fighting for their lives.</p>
<p class="para-p">Meanwhile, Marcellinus was watching the skies.</p>
<p class="para-p">At first he thought there were spots in his eyes, perhaps afterimages of the flashes of light from polished Roman helmets. He blinked and squinted. They were real.</p>
<p class="para-p">A trumpet shrieked, and at the same time Sollonius said: “Thunderbirds, incoming. Bit low, though. Sir?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus grinned. “Look again, adjutant.”</p>
<p class="para-p">It was rare indeed that Marcellinus got to correct someone else on his long-distance vision.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page405" title="405"/>
<p class="para-p">Here they came, slow and stately: three Sky Lanterns in free flight, riding the wind at an altitude of about fifteen hundred feet.</p>
<p class="para-p">“A Sky Lantern can carry a far heavier cargo than a Wakinyan,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Liquid flame?” Enopay shook his head. “But they can’t steer. Can’t go back…”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Once they drop their load, they’ll rise in altitude. They’ll go west with the wind, hopefully far beyond the battlefield. Once down, the crews will cross the Wemissori and find their way back. If we can, we’ll send horses for them.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Your idea? It sounds like you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Rather them than me,” Sollonius said with fervor.</p>
<p class="para-p">The clangor of sword against shield, spear against sword drew Marcellinus’s attention back to his front line. He spurred his horse forward without responding but overheard Enopay’s wry reply: “Probably safer up there in the skies than down here with the Praetor.”</p>
<p class="para-p">It took another ten minutes before the Sky Lanterns passed over their heads on their inexorable journey toward the Mongol line.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sollonius nodded. “All right, this time I’m certain. Thunderbirds, incoming.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And Sintikala is overhead,” Enopay reported in Cahokian and sotto voce.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus glanced up just once. Yes, the woman he loved was flying two thousand feet above his head.</p>
<p class="para-p">Did she know he was there? Of course she did. Even if she couldn’t see him.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">A dogfight broke out above the Sixth shortly afterward. Firebirds formed the vanguard of a Mongol aerial blitz, followed by two of the writhing and disconcerting Feathered Serpents of the Maya.</p>
<p class="para-p">One of the Serpents dropped a thunder crash bomb over the Sixth Ferrata. It exploded just as it hit the ground and tore an immense hole in the Fourth Cohort, flinging men through the air, screaming in pain.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page406" title="406"/>
<p class="para-p">Its second bomb exploded above the Eighth. Molten shrapnel rained down on Vibius Caecina’s men, but the loss of life was much less, and it was the last bomb the Serpent managed to deliver. Six Eagles and Hawks converged on it from three directions with startling rapidity, perforating its wing with the broad-headed arrows devised by Sintikala that would maximize the rips in the canvas. Those arrows must have done serious damage, because rather than merely fluttering down to earth the Feathered Serpent folded and plummeted, barely missing the third rank of the Ninth as it smashed into the ground.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sintikala, overhead again,” Enopay said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus grunted. “You don’t say.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The second Serpent writhed leftward sharply, heading for the Third Legion. “Good. Let them go and bother Decinius Sabinus for a while.”</p>
<p class="para-p">To his right the tip of the latest Mongol Chisel had impacted his First Cohort front and center, and the enemy cavalry was carving a hole in his front line. Legionaries fell back, and centurions and optios snarled vile threats at their own men. Appius Gallus himself was running in on foot carrying a contus lance, which he thrust into the face of a Mongol heavy at the front of the line. Good man.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus was looking for the Wakinyan, and now he saw them. They had looped to the south to avoid the aerial conflict with the Feathered Serpents and were returning to their course. They began to separate, fanning out in the sky, just as he, Sintikala, and Chenoa had planned the previous evening—</p>
<p class="para-p">“Shit,” Sollonius said. “Jupiter, fuck, sir: <em class="char-i">take cover</em>!”</p></div></body></html>

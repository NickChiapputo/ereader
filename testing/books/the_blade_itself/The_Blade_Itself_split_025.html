<div id="filepos672160" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Three Signs</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West crashed onto his arse, one of his steels skittering out of his hands and across the cobbles. “That’s a touch!” shouted Marshal Varuz, “A definite touch! Well fought, Jezal, well fought!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West was starting to tire of losing. He was stronger than Jezal, and taller, with a better reach, but the cocky little bastard was quick. Damn quick, and getting quicker. He knew all of West’s tricks now, more or less, and if he kept improving at this rate he’d soon be beating him every time. Jezal knew it too. He had a smile of infuriating smugness on his face as he offered his hand to West and helped him up from the ground.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We’re getting somewhere now!” Varuz slapped his stick against his leg in delight. “We may even have ourselves a champion, eh, Major?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Very likely, sir,” said West, rubbing at his elbow, bruised and throbbing from his fall. He looked sidelong at Jezal, basking in the warmth of the Marshal’s praise.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But we must not grow complacent!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No, sir!” said Jezal emphatically.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No indeed,” said Varuz, “Major West is a capable fencer, of course, and you are privileged to have him as a partner but, well,” and he grinned at West, “fencing is a young man’s game, eh, Major?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course it is, sir,” muttered West. “A young man’s game.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bremer dan Gorst, I expect, will be a different sort of opponent, as will the others at this year’s Contest. Less of the veteran’s cunning, perhaps, but more of the vigour of youth, eh West?” West, at thirty, was still feeling somewhat vigorous, but there was no purpose in arguing. He knew he’d never been the most gifted swordsman in the world. “We have made great progress this past month, great progress. You have a chance, if you can maintain your focus. A definite chance! Well done! I will see you both tomorrow.” And the old Marshal strutted from the sunny courtyard.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West walked over to his fumbled steel, lying on the cobbles by the wall. His side was still aching from the fall, and he had to bend awkwardly to get it. “I have to be going, myself,” he grunted as he straightened up, trying to hide his discomfort as best he could.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Important business?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Marshal Burr has asked to see me.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Is it to be war then?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Perhaps. I don’t know.” West looked Jezal up and down. He was avoiding West’s eye for some reason. “And you? What have you got in mind for today?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal fiddled with his steels. “Er, nothing planned… not really.” He glanced up furtively. For such a good card player, the man was a useless liar.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West felt a niggling of worry. “Ardee wouldn’t be involved in your lack of plans would she?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Erm…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The niggling became a cold throbbing. “Well?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Maybe,” snapped Jezal, “well… yes.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West stepped right up to the younger man. “Jezal,” he heard himself saying, slowly through gritted teeth, “I hope you’re not planning to fuck my sister.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Now look here—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The throbbing boiled over. West’s hands gripped hold of Jezal by his shoulders. “No, </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">you</span></span><span class="calibre3"> look!” he snarled. “I’ll not have her trifled with, you understand? She’s been hurt before, and I’ll not see her hurt any more! Not by you, not by anyone! I won’t stand for it! She’s not one of your games, you hear me?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Alright,” said Jezal, face suddenly pale. “Alright! I’ve no designs on her! We’re just friends is all. I like her! She doesn’t know anyone here and… you can trust me… there’s no harm in it! Ah! Get off me!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West realised he was squeezing Jezal’s arms with all his strength. How had that happened? He’d only meant to have a quiet word, and now he’d gone way too far. Hurt before… damn it! He should never have said that! He let go suddenly, drew back, swallowing his fury. “I don’t want you seeing her any more, do you hear me?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Now hold on West, who are you to—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West’s anger began to pulse again. “Jezal,” he growled, “I’m your friend, so I’m asking you.” He stepped forward again, closer than ever. “And I’m her brother, so I’m warning you. Stay away! No good can come of it!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal shrank back against the wall. “Alright… alright! She’s your sister!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West turned and stalked towards the archway, rubbing the back of his neck, his head thumping.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Lord Marshal Burr was sitting and staring out of the window when West arrived at his offices. A big, grim, beefy man with a thick brown beard and a simple uniform. West wondered how bad the news would be. If the Marshal’s face was anything to go by it was very bad indeed.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Major West,” he said, glaring up from under his heavy brows. “Thank you for coming.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course, sir.” West noticed three roughly-made wooden boxes on a table by the wall. Burr saw him looking at them.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gifts,” he said sourly, “from our friend in the north, Bethod.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gifts?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“For the King, it seems.” The Marshal scowled and sucked at his teeth. “Why don’t you have a look at what he sent us, Major?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West walked over to the table, reached out and cautiously opened the lid of one of the boxes. An unpleasant smell flowed out, like well-rotted meat, but there was nothing inside but some brown dirt. He opened the next box. The smell was worse. More brown dirt, caked around the inside, and some hair, some strands of yellow hair. West swallowed, looked up at the frowning Lord Marshal. “Is this all, sir?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Burr snorted. “If only. The rest we had to bury.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bury?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Marshal picked up a sheet of paper from his desk. “Captain Silber, Captain Hoss, Colonel Arinhorm. Those names mean anything to you?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West felt sick. That smell. It reminded him of Gurkhul somehow, of the battlefield. “Colonel Arinhorm, I know,” he mumbled, staring at the three boxes, “by reputation. He’s commander of the garrison at Dunbrec.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Was,” corrected Burr, “and the other two commanded small outposts nearby, on the frontier.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The frontier?” mumbled West, but he already guessed what was coming.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Their heads, Major. The Northmen sent us their heads.” West swallowed, looking at the yellow hairs stuck to the inside of the box. “Three signs, they said, when it was time.” Burr got up from his chair and stood, looking out of the window. “The outposts were nothing: wooden buildings mostly, a palisade wall, ditches and so on, lightly manned. Little strategic importance. Dunbrec is another matter.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“It commands the fords on the Whiteflow,” said West numbly, “the best way out of Angland.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Or in. A vital point. Considerable time and resources were spent on the defences there. The very latest designs were used, our finest architects. A garrison of three hundred men, with stores of weapons and food to stand a year of siege. It was considered impregnable, the lynchpin of our plans for the defence of the frontier.” Burr frowned, deep grooves appearing across the bridge of his nose. “Gone.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West’s head had started hurting again. “When, sir?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“When is the question. It must have been at least two weeks ago, for these “gifts” to have reached us. I am being called defeatist,” said Burr sourly, “but I guess that the Northmen are loose and that, by now, they have overrun half of northern Angland. A mining community or two, several penal colonies, nothing so far of major importance, no towns to speak of, but they are coming, West, and fast, you may be sure of that. You don’t send heads to your enemy, then wait politely for a reply.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What is being done?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Precious little! Angland is in uproar, of course. Lord Governor Meed is raising every man, determined to march out and beat Bethod on his own, the idiot. Varying reports place the Northmen anywhere and everywhere, with a thousand men or a hundred thousand. The ports are choked with civilians desperate to escape, rumours are rife of spies and murderers loose in the country, and mobs seek out citizens with Northern blood and beat them, rob them, or worse. Put simply, it is chaos. Meanwhile we sit here on our fat arses, waiting.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But… weren’t we warned? Didn’t we know?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course!” Burr threw his broad hand up in the air, “but no one took it very seriously, would you believe! Damn painted savage stabs himself on the floor of the Open Council, challengess us before the King, and nothing is done! Government by committee! Everyone pulling their own way! You can only react, never prepare!” The Marshal coughed and burped, spat on the floor. “Gah! Damn it! Damn indigestion!” He sat back in his chair, rubbing his stomach unhappily.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West hardly knew what to say. “How do we proceed?” he mumbled.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“We’ve been ordered north immediately, meaning as soon as anyone can be bothered to supply me with men and arms. The King, meaning that drunkard Hoff, has commanded me to bring these Northmen to heel. Twelve regiments of the King’s Own—seven of foot and five of horse, to be fleshed out with levies from the aristocracy, and whatever the Anglanders haven’t squandered before we get there.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West shifted uncomfortably in his chair. “That should be an overwhelming force.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh,” grunted the Marshal. “It better be. It’s everything we have, more or less, and that worries me.” West frowned. “Dagoska, Major. We cannot fight the Gurkish and the Northmen both at once.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“But surely, sir, the Gurkish, they wouldn’t risk another war so soon? I thought it was all idle talk?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I hope so, I hope so.” Burr pushed some papers absently around his desk. “But this new Emperor, Uthman, is not what we were expecting. He was the youngest son, but when he heard of his father’s death… he had all his brothers strangled. Strangled them himself, some say. Uthman-ul-Dosht, they are calling him. Uthman the Merciless. He has already declared his intention to recapture Dagoska. Empty talk, perhaps. Perhaps not.” Burr pursed his lips. “They say he has spies everywhere. He might even now be learning of our troubles in Angland, might even now be preparing to take advantage of our weakness. We must be done quickly with these Northmen. Very quickly. Twelve regiments and levies from the noblemen. And from that point of view it could not be a worse time.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Sir?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“This business with the Mercers. A bad business. Some of the big noblemen got stung. Brock, Isher, Barezin, and others. Now they’re dragging their feet with the levies. Who knows what they’ll send us, or when? Bunch of half-starved, unarmed beggars probably, an excuse to clean the scrapings from their land. A useless crowd of extra mouths to feed, and clothe, and arm, and we are desperately short of good officers.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I have some good men in my battalion.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Burr twitched impatiently. “Good men, yes! Honest men, enthusiastic men, but not experienced! Most of those who fought in the South did not enjoy it. They have left the army, and have no intention of returning. Have you seen how young the officers are these days? We’re a damn finishing school! And now His Highness the Prince has expressed his interest in a command. He doesn’t even know which end of a sword to hold, but he is set on glory and I cannot refuse him!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Prince Raynault?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“If only!” shouted Burr. “Raynault might actually be of some use! It’s Ladisla I’m talking of! Commanding a division! A man who spends a thousand marks a month on clothes! His lack of discipline is notorious! I’ve heard it said that he’s forced himself on more than one servant in the palace, but that the Arch Lector was able to silence the girls.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Surely not,” said West, although he had actually heard such a rumour himself.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The heir to the throne, in harm’s way, when the King is in poor health? A ludicrous notion!” Burr got up, burping and wincing. “Damn this stomach!” He stalked over to the window and frowned out across the Agriont.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“They think it will be easily settled,” he said quietly. “The Closed Council. A little jaunt in Angland, done with before the first snow falls. In spite of this shock with Dunbrec. They never learn. They said the same about our war with the Gurkish, and that nearly finished us. These Northmen are not the primitives they think. I fought with Northern mercenaries in Starikland: hard men used to hard lives, raised on warfare, fearless and stubborn, expert at fighting in the hills, in the forests, in the cold. They do not follow our rules, or even understand them. They will bring a violence and a savagery to the battlefield that would make the Gurkish blush.” Burr turned away from the window, back to West. “You were born in Angland, weren’t you, Major?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, sir, in the south, near Ostenhorm. My family’s farm was there, before my father died…” He trailed off.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You were raised there?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You know the land then?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West frowned. “In that region, sir, but I have not been back for—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Do you know these Northmen?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Some. There are still many living in Angland.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You speak their tongue?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, a little, but they speak many—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Good. I am putting together a staff, good men I can rely on to carry out my orders, and see to it that this army of ours does not fall apart before it even comes into contact with the enemy”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course, sir.” West racked his brains. “Captain Luthar is a capable and intelligent officer, Lieutenant Jalenhorm—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bah!” shouted Burr, waving his hand in frustration, “I know Luthar, the boy’s a cretin! Just the sort of bright-eyed child that I was talking about! It’s you I need, West.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Me?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, you! Marshal Varuz, the Union’s most famous soldier no less, has given you a glowing report. He says you are a most committed, tenacious, and hard-working officer. The very qualities I need! As a Lieutenant you fought in Gurkhul under Colonel Glokta, did you not?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West swallowed. “Well, yes.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“And it is well known you were first through the breach at Ulrioch.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Well, among the first, I was—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You have led men in the field, and your personal courage is beyond question! There is no need to be modest, Major, you are the man for me!” Burr sat back, a smile on his face, confident he had made his point. He burped again, holding up his hand. “My apologies… damn indigestion!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Sir, may I be blunt?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“I am no courtier, West. You must always be blunt with me. I demand it!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“An appointment on a Lord Marshal’s staff, sir, you must understand. I am a gentleman’s son. A commoner. As commander of a battalion, I already have difficulty gaining the respect of the junior officers. The men I would have to give orders to if I were on your staff, sir, senior men with good blood…” He paused, exasperated. The Marshal gazed blankly at him. “They will not permit it!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Burr’s eyebrows drew together. “Permit it?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Their pride will not allow it, sir, their—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Damn their pride!” Burr leaned forward, his dark eyes fixed on West’s face. “Now listen to me, and listen carefully. Times are changing. I don’t need men with good blood. I need men who can plan, and organise, give orders, and follow them. There will lie no room in my army for those who cannot do as they are told, I don’t care how noble they are. As a member of my staff you represent me, and I will not be slighted or ignored.” He burped suddenly, and smashed the table with his fist. “I will see to it!” he roared. “Times are changing! They may not smell it yet, but they soon will!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West stared dumbly back. “In any case,” and Burr waved a dismissive hand, “I am not consulting with you, I am informing you. This is your new assignment. Your King needs you, your country needs you, and that is all. You have five days to hand over command of your battalion.” And the Lord Marshal turned back to his papers.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Yes, sir,” muttered West.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He fumbled the door shut behind him with numb fingers, walked slowly down the hallway, staring at the floor. War. War in the North. Dunbrec fallen, the Northmen loose in Angland. Officers hurried around him. Someone brushed past, but he hardly noticed. There were people in danger, mortal danger! People he knew maybe, neighbours from home. There was fighting even now, inside the Union’s borders! He rubbed his jaw. This war could be a terrible thing. Worse than Gurkhul had been, even, and he would be at the heart of it. A place on a Lord Marshal’s staff. Him? Collem West? A commoner? He still could hardly believe it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West felt a sneaking, guilty glow of satisfaction. It was for just such an appointment that he had been working like a dog all these years. If he did well there was no telling where he might go. This war was a bad thing, a terrible thing, no doubt. He felt himself grinning. A terrible thing. But it just might be the making of him.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_25"></div></div></body>

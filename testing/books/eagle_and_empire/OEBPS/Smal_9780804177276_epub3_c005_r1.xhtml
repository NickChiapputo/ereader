<p class="para-pf-alt" style="text-indent:0;"><span class="stickupcaps char-dropcap cso_15">“A</span>h, Gaius Marcellinus, run to ground at last.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay’s mouth dropped open as the Imperator Hadrianus stepped down into Marcellinus’s hut. On this day Hadrianus wore full uniform and armor, with his helmet tucked under his arm. His Imperial presence filled the room and stole all the air.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Caesar.” Belatedly Marcellinus rose to his feet and saluted. “I…did not expect—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, of course you didn’t.” Hadrianus surveyed his rude surroundings with some disdain: the low bed, and the bench and table where Marcellinus to this day schooled young Cahokians in reading and writing. His eyes lingered on the golden lares sitting on Marcellinus’s small shrine to his household gods. He inspected the hearth, peered up through the crude chimney hole at the skies beyond. “And these are the barbarian accommodations that you favor over the barracks of the Third Parthica?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, Caesar.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Well, well. And have you given much thought to your future, I wonder?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“My future, Caesar?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus looked at Enopay, who stammered, “I…I should leave, Caesar?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page61" title="61"/>
<p class="para-p">“Stay, stay.” The Imperator gestured at the pot of goldenrod tea sitting over the embers of the fire. “If I may?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of course, Caesar…Enopay, find the Imperator a cup.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The master of the world now investigated the bench with care, perhaps looking for splinters, and then sat. “So, your future, Gaius Marcellinus?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I sometimes believe I have an excess of good fortune in merely surviving to see each new dawn,” Marcellinus said cautiously.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Indeed you do. Until now, you have been useful enough to be kept alive. What use do you plan to be to me going forward?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus shook his head, baffled. “I will help complete the Line of Hadrianus. I will work with Tahtay and the Cahokian auxiliaries to prepare them for the coming war. And I will do my best to prevent Agrippa from upending our treaty with Cahokia into a bloody disaster.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Such small ambitions.” The Imperator looked at Enopay, who was still fumbling to find a clean beaker. “What do you think, boy? What sensible use can I make of this renegade?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay’s eyes were wide, and his face flushed. “Already the Wanageeska has brought you great allies. He has prevented war between your people and ours, made sure your legions are fed. The First Cahokian—”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus shrugged negligently. “I suppose he has brought me one nation. But I have it in mind that he should bring me another.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Holy Jove,” Marcellinus said. “Caesar, no, I beg of you. I must stay here.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus smiled thinly. “You have not even heard my proposal.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“He does not need to.” At last Enopay handed a beaker of tea to the Imperator. “We were both there yesterday, when you were looking at the map of Hesperia. You plan to send Gaius Marcellinus to the southwest in an attempt to ally with the People of the Hand.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus took a sip. “Who better?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus opened his mouth and closed it again.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I do hope you were not about to suggest Calidius Verus, even in jest. Since it seems he has antagonized the Yokot’an Maya, it would be naive to expect him to do any better with the People of the Hand. And it seems we know little of the Hand and what we might expect from them. The task requires a commander of some subtlety, along with an abundance of local knowledge. You would disagree?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page62" title="62"/>
<p class="para-p">“No,” Marcellinus said. “But I do not know all your tribunes, nor do I know which could be spared from their other duties—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“None of them,” the Imperator said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus snapped his fingers as an inspiration struck. “Centurion Manius Ifer of the Sixth Ferrata. He has been in country for years and seems to have gained extensive experience at leading mixed Roman and Hesperian expeditionary units—”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus was already shaking his head. “You studied the map as carefully as I, Gaius Marcellinus. We are as close to the People of the Hand here as they are at the Market of the Mud. There is even a redskin trail that goes there, across the Plains and along a river. Long, undoubtedly tedious, but straightforward enough. Easy country and fresh water until you get to the Great Mountains, and then you follow them down.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“But that must be a thousand miles,” Marcellinus objected.</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay was considering it. “Over a thousand either way. But to send an expedition of the Sixth, we would first need to send word two months down the Mizipi to their fortress on the gulf coast beyond the Market of the Mud. Then Verus’s men would have to travel around the bay and up, through the full heat of the desert…” He trailed off at Marcellinus’s expression. “I will stop speaking now.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Thank you, Enopay.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator looked amused. “And if that were not enough, Verus has his hands full. His fleet patrols the whole of the Hesperian Nile, from the rapids two hundred miles north of here clear down to the Mare Solis. Not to mention his role in helping extend our signal stations along the Wemissori and the three other major tributaries out of the west that drain into the Mizipi. He is, in fact, at our harbor on the Oyo right now, putting the finishing touches to those logistics. So, Marcellinus, a joint force of Romans and Hesperians: that is your recommendation?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, of course.” Marcellinus took a deep breath. “But Caesar, I cannot go.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You defy your Imperator?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page63" title="63"/>
<p class="para-p">“I am needed here. Am I not?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You flatter yourself, Gaius Marcellinus. I do believe that by pooling our considerable talents and calling upon Tahtay’s, Praetor Sabinus and I may be able to handle Cahokia in your absence.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“With Agrippa always a hairbreadth from unleashing his legionaries upon Cahokia?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You think me incapable of reining in Lucius Agrippa?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus backtracked quickly. “By no means, Caesar. I merely mean that you cannot be everywhere. Often you are out in the Grass—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“What if the Mongols arrive here while we are away?” Enopay said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus turned on him. <em class="char-i">“We?”</em></p>
<p class="para-p">“It seems unlikely. Our scouts would have warned us. But yes, you’d better not dally.” Hadrianus walked to the door and looked down at the step as if irritated that he had to clamber up it to escape the house.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Caesar, I implore you—”</p>
<p class="para-p">Unexpectedly, Hadrianus cut him off with a Hesperian hand-talk gesture: <em class="char-i">Be silent</em>. He turned. “Oh, and one other thing. That odd moment when Tahtay made you swear upon your daughter’s life. He spoke, naturally, of Vestilia?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Lying to the Imperator could be a death sentence. Marcellinus had never told a bald-faced lie to an Imperator of Roma in his life, and today would be a poor day to start. “No, Caesar.”</p>
<p class="para-p">A half smile played on Hadrianus’s lips. “You sly old fox. You have a Cahokian daughter?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I do, Caesar. Although I would prefer that you not ask me where she might be found.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator made a great show of considering it. “<em class="char-i">Perhaps</em> such a thing might be agreed to. But we need not discuss it further, Gaius Marcellinus, and it need not become common knowledge in the legions as long as you grant me the service for which I have asked. Which is not such a bad thing as all that. After all, I propose to give you responsibility, an opportunity to command honest Romans again after all these years relegated to keeping Hesperians in order. And I know how you hanker to travel. This task should be right up your alley. Which Cahokians would do for the task, d’you suppose?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page64" title="64"/>
<p class="para-p">After a dazed moment, Marcellinus’s mind began working again. He looked apologetically at Enopay. “Kanuna, if he could be persuaded to make such a long trip. He is the most flexible and…statesmanlike of the older Cahokians. Mahkah, and some of the other young warriors who are already accustomed to working with Romans and have traveled far in the past. Of course, we will also need translators who speak the languages of the Caddo and the Hand.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator pushed the doorskin aside. Beyond it Marcellinus saw four Praetorian guards standing watch, looking hot and uncomfortable. Their armor gleamed in the sun. “I concur with your plan. Select your Cahokians. I will have a warship sent from our Oyo harbor to ferry you along the Wemissori; it should arrive in a week or so. You will travel with four turmae of the Ala II Hispanorum Aravacorum under the command of the senior decurion Sextus Bassus. Bassus is a fine horseman and runs a tight expedition.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, Caesar.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Hadrianus gave him a long, appraising stare. “Gaius Marcellinus, despite your fond opinion of yourself you have very few uses to me, and men with so many flaws do not customarily survive long in my favor. You wish to ensure your future with Roma? Go and earn it. You pride yourself on forging alliances? Go and forge another.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, Caesar.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The Imperator stepped out of the house. The doorskin fell back into place behind him.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Shit.” Marcellinus sat down on his bench with a thud. All of a sudden he vividly recalled the scorching sun, the blistering heat of Arabia. And now he had to travel deep into another desert on what was probably a fool’s errand and ridiculously dangerous besides. Once again he had to make a huge journey at what might be exactly the wrong time.</p>
<p class="para-p">And if that were not bad enough, Hadrianus knew he had a Cahokian daughter. “Futete. Damn it.” Stricken, he looked at Enopay.</p>
<p class="para-p">The boy leaned in so close that even an eavesdropper just outside the hut would not be able to hear. “Do not fear, Eyanosa. Most Cahokians do not even know you consider Kimi your daughter. And those who do? No Cahokian would give her away.” Enopay stepped up to the door and peered out. Quietly, over his shoulder, he said: “And if Hadrianus does look, it will be for a girl much younger than fifteen winters. As long as you do what he asks, I do not believe he will bother. And all that about you having no other uses? He is just…Gaius?”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page65" title="65"/>
<p class="para-p">Enopay had turned to find Marcellinus with one hand on his golden lares and the other on a piece of old curled-up birch bark that lay on the shrine beside them. A piece of bark on which was written, in a rounded scrawl of charcoal, <em class="char-i">Kimi thank Gaius</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was time to hide that piece of bark. Very carefully. For the time being, Marcellinus tucked it into the straw in his mattress. “Perhaps you are right.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Enopay nodded. “Of course I am right. Come. Let us go and talk to my grandfather.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus followed him to the door. “Very well. But one thing I am absolutely sure of, Enopay, is that <em class="char-i">you</em> will not be joining us on this crazy trip.”</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">Mahkah and Hanska jumped at the chance to accompany him on the expedition into the southwest, and much to his surprise, so did the elderly Kanuna. Although they all stoutly claimed loyalty to Marcellinus as their primary reason, he was aware that the long shadows cast by the Roman fortresses over the city of Cahokia provided an even more powerful motivation. In addition, Kanuna had spent years of his youth traveling, and this probably would be his last chance to see somewhere new. Besides, for one who felt the cold as acutely as the elder did, traveling south for the winter must have had its appeal.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus suspected that if he had issued a call for volunteers, a large fraction of the First Cahokian would have signed up, but there were good reasons to limit the number of Hesperians on the expedition. The Roman cavalry had trained together for years and were well accustomed to spending long days in the saddle. The Cahokians were learning fast, but few showed the natural riding aptitude of Mahkah and Hanska.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page66" title="66"/>
<p class="para-p">It would be bad enough just having to deal with Kanuna and Enopay, both of whom were horse-averse by inclination but suddenly well motivated to become expert riders. For to everyone’s astonishment, not only did Kanuna and Hanska support Enopay’s desire to come along on the journey, so did the expedition lead, Sextus Bassus, whom Enopay had somehow managed to impress with his bookkeeping skills. Kanuna claimed he had taken his first trip to faraway Etowah when he was little older than his grandson, and Hanska was always sympathetic to outsiders. And so Marcellinus gave it up, and Enopay got his place on the expedition after all.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">She came to him out of the skies from the east, circling to gain height from the heat of the steelworks, looping up over the Great Mound and passing close by a Sky Lantern before swooping gracefully around him in a wide circle. From the top of the Mound of the Roman, Marcellinus watched and marveled at her skill in the air.</p>
<p class="para-p">She glided down behind him, passing so closely over his hut that she almost grazed it with her knees, then kicked her legs free and pushed up the nose of her Catanwakuwa. Spilling air and alighting onto her feet, she needed only a few steps to bring herself and her craft to a complete halt.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Very nice,” Marcellinus said. “You’re learning in…leaps and bounds.” Meant as a compliment, it came out sounding patronizing. “You got my message, then?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Would I be here if I had not?” Kimimela said. He stepped forward to help her with the straps, but she had already lifted the Hawk from her shoulders, and all Marcellinus could find to do was steady it as she lowered it to the ground.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Kimi, you once told me that I must tell you in person if I planned to leave Cahokia. Well, I am leaving now. Within the week.”</p>
<p class="para-p">That halted her. She looked up at him, the hurt in her eyes warring with her habitual disdain. “So soon? For how long?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hadrianus is sending me to seek an alliance with the People of the Hand.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Of the Hand? Shit…”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page67" title="67"/>
<p class="para-p">He tried a smile. “Bad word, Kimi.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She snorted. “Really? Anyone would think you were my father.”</p>
<p class="para-p">That silenced him. Kimimela dropped her gaze. “You will be gone many months. What will happen here while you are away?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Nothing bad, I hope.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Agrippa may use your absence as an opportunity to break the treaty. Even more than he has already. I expect he can’t wait to get you out of the way. This was his idea?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No. Agrippa is being kept busy completing the line of signal stations out in the Grass.” Marcellinus steeled himself. “Kimimela, it is not a good idea for me to keep secrets from Roma, but they still do not know that you…were once my daughter. I would like to keep them unaware of it.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“So you are telling me that I cannot come with you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">It had not occurred to him that she might consider it. “You would want to? It might be…” <em class="char-i">Dangerous?</em> He almost laughed. Was anywhere safe anymore?</p>
<p class="para-p">“Oh, I cannot go.” Kimimela pursed her lips. “My place now is with the Hawks and with my mother. And she cannot leave Cahokia either. But it would be nice if you had thought to ask me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I am taking some of the First Cahokian. Mahkah. Hanska and Mikasi. Kanuna and Enopay. Some guides and interpreters Verus will provide. And four turmae of Sabinus’s cavalry.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She raised her eyebrows. “Four what?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Four groups of thirty-two troopers. A hundred twenty-eight men and their horses.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Her expression was sour. “And so you will lead Romans again.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“The turmae come with their own commander. Sextus Bassus.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“But you will command Bassus, of course.” She looked at him with deep pain. “You are one person to Roma and another person to Cahokia. And you always have been.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I have never lied to you, Kimimela.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Except when it suited you.” She looked away, but at least she did not run from him.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page68" title="68"/>
<p class="para-p">He began to feel irritated. “I could not always tell you all I knew. But neither could you. You knew of Tahtay’s plan to bring the Army of Ten Thousand to the Roman fortresses last year. Did you tell me? You helped design the equipment that winched the Wakinyan into the air from level ground, along with Tahtay and Sintikala. Did any of you tell me about that? No, of course not.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“<em class="char-i">That</em> was different,” she said. “We served Cahokia. You always do what’s best for <em class="char-i">you</em>.”</p>
<p class="para-p">His exasperation grew. “Easiest for me would be to serve Roma hook, line, and sinker. Am I doing that?”</p>
<p class="para-p">She looked at him coolly. “Aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I’m trying to do what’s best for everyone. Somehow. And…Holy Juno, Kimi…if I die on this trip, I don’t want harsh words like these to be the last we speak to each other. Not after all this. All right?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela grimaced.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus might never have the chance to say this again. “Kimimela, I love you. The day I became your father was the proudest…” He swallowed and began again. “You and Sintikala are the most important people in my life. I will do everything I can to keep you safe. Everything. I would die for you. And that is the truth.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela closed her eyes. When she opened them again, they were damp and glittering, her face forlorn. Marcellinus’s heart almost broke in that moment. He reached out to her, but she held up her hand. “But what? Always with the Wanageeska there is a ‘but.’ A something-else.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The silence expanded between them. Kimimela stared into his eyes.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Very well. <em class="char-i">But</em> still I have to try to serve both Roma and Cahokia. Keep as many other people alive as possible—both Roman and Cahokian. And prepare to face the Mongol Khan. And so I must go to the southwest. The Imperator believes that he is coercing me to go, but in fact he is right, Kimi. I am the only man for the job. I <em class="char-i">should</em> go.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela looked away across the plaza. Evening was coming, and the shadows were growing long.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Kimimela? Please say something.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I am bleeding,” she said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“What?” He scanned her briefly in alarm.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page69" title="69"/>
<p class="para-p">“Not…” She took another breath. “What I mean is, my moon time has started. Several moons ago, in fact. I am not a girl anymore, Gaius. I am a woman.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala had not told him. Marcellinus inhaled deeply, blew it out, looked up at the graying sky. He felt awkward beyond measure and had no idea what to say. <em class="char-i">Congratulations?</em></p>
<p class="para-p">“And so, as an adult, I need no father.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She was telling him it was over once and for all.</p>
<p class="para-p">His heart was heavy. Perhaps it was just as well he was leaving Cahokia. “I understand.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“But,” said Kimimela, and now her mouth quirked. “But nonetheless…”</p>
<p class="para-p">She had said “nonetheless” in Latin. She was mocking him. The fading sunlight played about her face. Marcellinus waited, but she said nothing more. “Kimimela, what?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Despite that, when you leave Cahokia and trek all those weeks across the Grass to the deserts in the southwest…you <em class="char-i">will</em> go as my father, Gaius.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Now it was she who reached out. Marcellinus grabbed her hands like a man drowning, before she could change her mind. Kimimela smiled at his haste and then tugged him closer. For one of the few times in their lives, father and daughter hugged. “Gods,” Marcellinus said. “Thank you, Kimi. Thank you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And I love you,” she said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“All right,” he said, startled, and she laughed.</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela released him, and he stepped back.</p>
<p class="para-p">“I love you, Gaius, Father,” she said again very seriously. “Even though I am very often angry with you, I am angry with you <em class="char-i">because</em> I love you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I love you, too, Kimimela.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Suddenly he could not bear the thought of leaving her. “Kimimela…could you not come with me?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Kimimela hesitated. For a moment he thought maybe she was considering it after all and belatedly wondered what Sintikala would say about it.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page70" title="70"/>
<p class="para-p">“No,” she said eventually. “Really I cannot. I <em class="char-i">do</em> wish I could. I would like to travel by your side again. But for now my place is here. I must fly with my mother, and I must stand with Tahtay and tell him when to breathe, to stop him losing his temper and getting men killed. So go without me. But…do not forget me.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I never will, Kimimela,” Marcellinus said. “Never.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“We will have our time together one day,” Kimimela said. “Won’t we?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes, we will.”</p>
<p class="para-p">For a very long time she stood still, looking out over Cahokia from the top of the low Mound of the Roman. Then she said, “Because that is what I have wanted. And have never really had.”</p>
<p class="para-p">His vision blurred. He put his hands up to his face.</p>
<p class="para-p">“Do not swear that we will,” Kimimela said. “For that, you cannot swear.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Eyes closed, Marcellinus wondered how to answer her, but when he finally opened them again, she had gone, had run down the side of the mound, leaving her Hawk wing resting in the grass beside him.</p>
<div class="section_break">—</div>
<p class="para-sp">In all the years Marcellinus had spent in Cahokia he had never been atop the Great Mound at night. He had stood there when the sun set, first when his life was in Great Sun Man’s hands and later when Tahtay had taken over as paramount chief, but he had always left before dusk was over and full night had descended.</p>
<p class="para-p">And this night was especially dark. It was the new moon, and heavy cloud blanketed the city in humidity, shrouding the starlight. The cedar steps up the mound were mostly level and even, but Marcellinus had still managed to trip over his own feet several times on his way to the mound’s crest.</p>
<p class="para-p">Once there, he stopped and turned. Despite the heat, Cahokia was studded with cooking fires. Their smoke, along with the aroma of roasting meat and corn, reached Marcellinus even at this height. Within and between the houses, often appearing to float back and forth through the streets and across the plazas, were the faint glows of lanterns in the hands of Cahokians going about their duties before turning in for the night.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page71" title="71"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus looked left. Far away to the east were the bluffs, but he could not see them in the haze. Closer was the steady glow of the foundry in the steelworks and a much fainter glimmer of lamplight from the Big Warm House. In the summer months they let the furnaces idle, but the older Cahokians still went to the baths to soak their aching limbs in the hot air and cool water and complain about their grandchildren.</p>
<p class="para-p">To his right the fires and lamps of western Cahokia extended as far as the river in cheerful disarray, all but disappearing into the murk. But beyond them the fortress of Legio III Parthica shone bright, its walls and streets defined by rows of brilliant military lanterns. By comparison with the scattered flames of Cahokia the castra looked oddly square and sharp, almost sinister.</p>
<p class="para-p">And behind Marcellinus stood the Longhouse of the Wings, long and dark.</p>
<p class="para-p">The sweat on his arms and brow had cooled, and his breathing had calmed. Marcellinus turned and approached the longhouse. Its tall door was ajar, and no light came from within. Hesitating only a moment, he walked inside.</p>
<p class="para-p">Even to his night-adjusted eyes it seemed completely black within. He eased forward slowly, controlling his breathing, probing with each foot before putting his weight down to ensure that he would not trip over or bump into something he couldn’t see. He felt rather than saw the dozens of Hawk wings swaying in the air above him, suspended from the rafters. He smelled tanned deerskin, leather, flax, new wood.</p>
<p class="para-p">Ten short paces in, he stopped. Was she even here? “Sisika?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hotah,” said a male voice.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus jumped. His hand instinctively slapped at his belt, but of course he had brought no weapon onto the sacred mound. Yet even as he moved, he knew the voice. “Tahtay?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Sintikala will come to you presently.” The war chief was maybe twenty feet away to his left. Marcellinus turned to face him in the dark. “Why are you here, Tahtay? Is something wrong?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay blew out a huge breath. “What a question to ask me in a Cahokia occupied by Roma, in the heart of a land swarming with armies that care nothing for my people and live only to destroy one another. A Cahokia where listening ears are everywhere, where anyone I have not known all my life—and even some I have—may be a spy, reporting my words to the Imperator. Where the Wanageeska, my friend and the friend of my father, serves me but also his Imperator; today he wears Cahokian clothes, yesterday and tomorrow Roman armor. Even in the sweat lodge I cannot speak freely. Only here in the center of Cahokia, where we are the only men on a great and sacred mound inside a tall palisade, while Wahchintonka, Dustu, and a few other trusted men guard the gates below.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page72" title="72"/>
<p class="para-p">The war chief sounded sorrowful and older than his years. They were alone here in the dark, and so Marcellinus steeled himself and said the words that sounded traitorous even to his own ears. “I’m sorry, Tahtay. If there had been any way to keep Roma from your city—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps we should have faced them in battle after all?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No. Not that.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Footfalls, as Tahtay paced back and forth. He obviously had better night vision than Marcellinus. Perhaps he had gotten it from the wolves. “On that desperate day when our army stood on the hillside ready for war, Cahokia had a fighting chance. But now your Romans will destroy us from within. Grind us down like the Mizipi grinds the riverbank, leaving nothing behind.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Tahtay, the Romans need Cahokia. Its corn, its warriors, and its skills. Its flight and its liquid flame. Its knowledge of the land and the peoples that live here. And you are making them pay for what they receive.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“So that we will fight beside them against an impossible enemy.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“But Cahokia does not stand alone. Cahokia now leads a great Hesperian League: the Iroqua, the Powhatani, many of the other Algon-Quian peoples. And the Blackfoot.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I am hardly the master of those tribes the way the Imperator rules Roma or the Khan commands the Mongol Horde. Even within Cahokia I have to persuade and cajole.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Better to persuade by being right and lead from moral authority than force something wrong upon your people.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page73" title="73"/>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay laughed bitterly. “Moral authority, you say? Great Sun Man served Cahokia. He did not rule. I, too, serve the people.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And that is why Great Sun Man was a great leader, and why you are his worthy successor.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus wished they could have this discussion around a fire in the open air. He took a few cautious steps, swung his arms, hit nothing, and felt a little more free to move. “Tahtay, Cahokia forced the Romans to make their treaty by standing shoulder to shoulder with the other tribes of Nova Hesperia, and Cahokia can survive the coming war in the same way. By standing firm with the other Hesperian tribes you know now and more beside. I must leave soon for the People of the Hand. I go as a Roman, but if we succeed in allying with them, it will be because they, too, want to stand with their Hesperian brothers and sisters. Do you understand me?”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay had stopped pacing. “Perhaps.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And that is why I am taking Kanuna. For he can speak for Cahokia in a way I cannot.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I know. He and I have spoken of it in the smoke lodge.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus stared into the darkness. “I will be gone many months, but while I am traveling, you must solidify our other alliances. You must meet with the Tadodaho of the Haudenosaunee. The Iroqua are strong and terrible fighters. They must stand with us, and us with them. You must maintain and build on your close ties with the Blackfoot. And more: reach south to the other mound-builder towns, reach into the Grass to the tribes that live there, the Hidatsa, the Shoshoni, the Pawnee. Perhaps even to the Cherokee if Roma does not already own them.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He could almost hear Tahtay’s bitter smile. “All that?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“You are not alone. Use the people you trust. Sintikala has the respect of the Iroqua. Wachiwi was once of the Oneida. Others have strong ties to the Algon-Quian or have brothers and sisters in the Grass. You do not need to go in every direction, all at once, by yourself. Have the chiefs of those other Mizipian tribes brought here or somewhere close by.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And why would they agree?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Because otherwise they will be picked off one by one by the Mongols or by Roma. You are stronger when you all stand together. You know this.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page74" title="74"/>
<p class="para-p">“But if the Imperator…Ah.” Tahtay started to pace again. “Of course, Roma will want us to make these alliances, too, so that we can help fight their war with the Khan.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“And you <em class="char-i">will</em> have to help Roma fight its war. I do not pretend otherwise. This must be a true alliance with Roma. But once the war with the Mongols is won—”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Huh. We—”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus spoke over him remorselessly. “When the war is over, Hesperia must still be strong. Have I ever spoken to you of Tertius Gaudens?”</p>
<p class="para-p">They had been speaking in Cahokian, and the sudden words in Latin seemed harsh and violent. Tahtay grunted. “No. Who is that?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“It is a phrase, not a person. Tertius Gaudens, the Rejoicing Third. It is the military principle of letting two enemies fight each other so that a third can then defeat the weakened victor.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Tahtay blew out a long breath. “Hesperia can survive to be the Rejoicing Third?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Perhaps. But not at the expense of weakening Roma to the point where the Mongols…destroy them. For if the Romans are defeated by the Khan, then Cahokia—Hesperia—will fall, too.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He could almost hear Tahtay shaking his head. “It is so complicated. Sometimes I feel like I am falling off a tall rock. Tumbling down. But so slowly that it will take me a long time to hit the rocks at the bottom.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus laughed. “You are not a buffalo, Tahtay. And I am not Sooleawa.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“No. Alas. Sooleawa is a strong and handsome woman.” Tahtay paused. “You are taking Kanuna to the Hand to speak for Cahokia, and that is good. But you must also take Taianita.”</p>
<p class="para-p">That caught Marcellinus off guard. “Taianita?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Take her,” Tahtay said.</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus could scarcely imagine it. “This is a Roman military expedition, Tahtay. It will be a long hard trip with many dangers.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page75" title="75"/>
<p class="para-p">“You cannot promise to keep her safe? In a group of your own Romans?” Although he could not see Tahtay, Marcellinus could almost imagine his eyes narrowing.</p>
<p class="para-p">“It is not that,” he said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You will pass through Caddo lands,” Tahtay said. “She speaks Caddo and some words of other languages of the southern rivers and plains and deserts. And enough Latin to talk with the turmae.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Calidius Verus will provide translators.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Will you be able to trust them? You can trust her.”</p>
<p class="para-p">As Tahtay trusted her, Marcellinus suddenly realized. Taianita would be Tahtay’s eyes and ears on this expedition. But still…“She is young. And as the only girl surrounded by over a hundred legionaries, she might find things difficult.” Or <em class="char-i">make</em> them difficult, he thought.</p>
<p class="para-p">“You are taking Hanska, who is a woman. You are taking Enopay, who is also young. You have no excuse not to take Taianita. Hotah, I do not ask you for many things, but this? Please. It is important to me. I think it is the right thing to do. Will the Hand not have women chiefs as well as men? Is Taianita not persuasive? There are no Cahokian clan chiefs who can make the trip. She can help Kanuna, and she can help you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus sighed. “All right, Tahtay.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Good.” Now Marcellinus heard Tahtay scuffing at the ground with his moccasin. “And…Gaius? I am very sorry that I mentioned swearing on the life of your daughter. That was very foolish. Very foolish indeed. I was angry, and the wine was in my head, and for that moment I did not think. I needed you to swear on something, and…it came out. I am sometimes impetuous, too.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Yes,” Marcellinus said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“But Roma is so very hard to trust, and sometimes you are Roma. I needed to know for sure.” Tahtay’s voice turned doleful. “I think I am wise, but I am not wise. Perhaps I will never be a good leader. I would not have risked Kimimela’s life for anything. Is that what I have done? Is she in danger?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I hope not. Hadrianus promised not to seek her out as long as I led this expedition. And if he does, he will be looking for a girl much younger than Kimimela.” Marcellinus took a deep breath. “But as you say, Roma is hard to trust.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page76" title="76"/>
<p class="para-p">A long silence fell. Was he still there? “Tahtay?”</p>
<p class="para-p">“Hotah, I must ask yet another thing. Please do not die on this long trip to the southwest, because if you do…I fear for Cahokia. I fear for all the land.”</p>
<p class="para-p">The silence lengthened. “I’ll be back, Tahtay. With the People of the Hand as allies, I hope. In the meantime…strengthen the League.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I will do my best.”</p>
<p class="para-p">All of a sudden the air around Marcellinus felt different. The faintest of breezes touched his neck. Above him Hawks creaked and swayed as if the sky itself were roiling over his head.</p>
<p class="para-p">This time he did not need to ask. Tahtay was gone. Marcellinus knew it. “Juno.”</p>
<p class="para-p">From above him and to the left there came a sudden double thumping sound so abrupt that it made him leap sideways away from it. Marcellinus banged into wooden shelving, and falcon masks and rolls of cordage bounced off his shoulders and arms. “Merda…”</p>
<p class="para-p">After the thudding came the clatter of feet running to a standstill. For several long moments he heard nothing more. Then a faint rectangle of sky appeared above him, and a lithe figure dropped through it. He heard the slap of her feet as she landed on the rafters. Hawks trembled again. The rectangle of sky vanished as the trapdoor in the ceiling closed, and the longhouse was just as dark as it had been before.</p>
<p class="para-p">She knew Marcellinus was there. He was sure of it. He had not known she flew by night—it seemed ridiculously dangerous—but she must have waited to land until she saw Tahtay depart.</p>
<p class="para-p">Well, two could play at this night game. Marcellinus kept absolutely still and used all his concentration to try to sense where she was.</p>
<p class="para-p">It was hopeless. He might have had bandages over his ears and eyes for all he could tell of her whereabouts.</p>
<p class="para-p">The only credit he could take was that when her fingers grazed his arms, he did not lurch away in shock again.</p>
<p class="para-p">He reached out blindly and found her. His fingertips coaxed her closer.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page77" title="77"/>
<p class="para-p">Softly, slowly, Sisika drifted into his arms.</p>
<p class="para-p">Her hands slid up his arms to his shoulders and rested there. His fingers caressed the back of her flying tunic, coming to rest at her waist.</p>
<p class="para-p">She lifted her right hand. Very gently, she touched his cheek. He could hear her breathing, smell the rich leather she wore and the intoxicating aroma of her skin. He had the feeling she was gazing into his eyes, but he could not see her face at all, not even the outline of her.</p>
<p class="para-p">He leaned forward and down. His lips met the hard leather of her flying mask.</p>
<p class="para-p">She giggled quietly. It was an oddly intimate sound that he had not heard from her before. Her hand slid behind his head, tugging him forward. He ducked lower and found the soft skin of her neck. He nuzzled her, kissed it, slid his lips down until they met the top of her tunic.</p>
<p class="para-p">Lifting his hands from her waist, he felt for her mask, eased it up and away from her face, and found her lips with his fingers. She kissed them, an echo of the many times in the past he had kissed hers when she had placed them over his mouth to stop him from speaking. She squeezed his hand, kissed his fingers again, and for an instant he felt her tongue flicker across his knuckle, tasting him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Once more he leaned forward. Their lips met. Her mouth opened. They melted into each other, gentle but purposeful. She pulled him in even closer, stroking his cheek. Her tongue felt like fire in his mouth, the taste and smell of her maddening him with their intensity. Yet he savored those long moments in the dark, their hands upon each other, close and warm, with wings over their heads and the solidity of the Great Mound of Cahokia beneath their feet.</p>
<p class="para-p">He ran his hands down her sides again, over the supple leather. They both breathed more deeply now. Marcellinus swayed, for a moment unsure of his balance in the all-consuming dark, but she held him still. Her lips slipped away, and she laughed again, a young, delighted sound, as if she had no cares in the world and was thinking of nothing but him.</p>
<p class="para-p">Now she kissed his shoulders and his chest. He caressed her bare arms. Her hand slid down his arm to his wrist, and their fingers twined.</p>
<p class="para-p">Her lips found the scar on his arm where he had sworn an oath to her in blood years before, when they had faced imminent peril in Iroqua territory. She lingered there, exploring the scar with her tongue. It felt like a benediction, an affirmation, a rededication.</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page78" title="78"/>
<p class="para-p">Marcellinus tilted his head back and felt the whisper of the air from the Hawks against his temples. For a moment there were no wars, no conflicted allegiances. Time stood still, and his life was very simple.</p>
<p class="para-p">He found the ties that kept her tunic tight around her body and loosened them. His hands slid up under the leather, gliding across the warm skin beneath. He found scars and healed abrasions, the memories of bad landings and injuries sustained in fighting. With a shock that felt like lightning her hands were suddenly inside his tunic, too, rubbing up and across his stomach and chest and around to his back, tracing the shapes of his healed wounds, probing and kneading. As if they were medicus and healer as well as soldier and warrior, each of them traced the other’s violent history, blessing it, forgiving it. Marcellinus was gasping now with the intensity of the sensations that coursed through him; Sisika was silent except for her steady deep breathing. He had the impression she was concentrating intently, memorizing every detail of him.</p>
<p class="para-p">His hands continued on their journey of discovery. Just once, greatly daring, he ran his fingers around the curve of her breast. She sighed gently, leaning into the caress.</p>
<p class="para-p">Then her arms went around him, and she gripped him tightly and stopped moving.</p>
<p class="para-p">Still she had said nothing, but her meaning was clear. Reluctantly, Marcellinus slipped his hands out from beneath her tunic and rested them on her shoulders. Her forehead rested against his chest. He buried his face in her hair and breathed deeply.</p>
<p class="para-p">As quietly as he could whisper the words and still be heard, he murmured: “I love you, Sisika.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Her lips moved against his chest and her fingers against the skin of his arm: the same words, mouthed and in the hand-talk. <em class="char-i">I love you, Gaius</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">He felt light-headed, a little dizzy. “Never leave me.”</p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page79" title="79"/>
<p class="para-p"><em class="char-i">I am always with you. Always</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">Sintikala tilted her head back. “But I cannot be, Gaius.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He kissed her cheek, her neck. “I want to stay with you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“But you are leaving Cahokia again. Your Imperator tells you to go.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I must. For a while.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“To go where I cannot be with you.” She released him, stepped away. Marcellinus felt bereft at the loss of her; it was all he could do not to lunge forward and seize her again. “I do not want to be <em class="char-i">not there</em> for you, Gaius. In the wrong place.” Her voice was heavy with sorrow.</p>
<p class="para-p">She left the rest unsaid, but Marcellinus heard it anyway, the words she had spoken long ago after Great Sun Man had met his doom: <em class="char-i">When my husband was killed, when he needed me most, I was not with him, I was not there. Today-now, once again I was in the wrong place. Not there. It is my life, to never be there. To fail. And then men die</em>.</p>
<p class="para-p">She swallowed. “I cannot be there for you. You go alone.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I will come back to you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">She said nothing. He could still hear her breathing, and so he knew she had not slipped away. “Sisika? Even while I am gone…I will always be with you, too. Because I love you more than my life. If you could see into my eyes…”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I do not need to see your eyes, Gaius. Not tonight.” She took his hand, placed it over her heart. “Just come back to me.” Her voice was husky now. “Try hard.”</p>
<p class="para-p">“I will,” he said.</p>
<p class="para-p">“And I will fly. Always in the air. Always looking for you.”</p>
<p class="para-p">He thought it was over. Expected her to back away, perhaps to disappear from the longhouse as effortlessly as Tahtay, but she did not. She stood still for several long minutes while Marcellinus treasured her nearness and tried to commit every detail of the feel of her to his memory for the long months ahead.</p>
<p class="para-p">But then she stepped forward again, her strong body thumping firmly into his. He grabbed her like a drowning man. Their arms went around each other, and their lips met once more.</p>
<p class="para-p">Again, time and war went away.</p></div></body></html>

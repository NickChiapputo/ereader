<div id="filepos1081452" class="calibre1"><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre3"> Never Bet Against a Magus</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen sat in the hot sun, hunched over on his bench, and sweated. The ridiculous clothes did not help with the sweating, or indeed with anything else. The tunic had not been designed to sit down in, and the stiff leather dug painfully into his fruits whenever he tried to move.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Fucking thing,” he growled, tugging at it for the twentieth time. Quai looked hardly more comfortable in his magical garb—the glittering of the gold and silver symbols only served to make his face look the more ill and pallid, his eyes the more twitchy and bulging. He’d hardly spoken a word all morning. Of the three of them, only Bayaz appeared to be enjoying himself, beaming round at the surging crowds on the benches, the sunlight shining off his tanned pate.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">They stood out among the heaving audience like well-rotted fruit, and seemed about as popular. Even though the benches were packed shoulder to shoulder a small, nervous space had built up around the three of them where no one would sit.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The noise was even more crushing than the heat and the crowds. Logen’s ears hummed with the din. It was the most he could do to keep from clamping his hands over them and throwing himself under the bench for cover. Bayaz leaned towards him. “Was this what your duels were like?” He had to shout even though his mouth was barely six inches from Logen’s ear.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh.” Even when Logen had fought Rudd Threetrees, when a good part of Bethod’s army had drawn up in a great half-circle to watch, shouting and screaming and hammering their weapons against their shields, when the walls of Uffrith above them had been crammed with onlookers, his audience had not been half this size, not half this noisy. No more than thirty men had watched him kill Shama Heartless, kill him then butcher him like a pig. Logen winced and flinched and hunched his shoulders higher at the memory of it. Cutting, and cutting, and licking the blood from his fingers, while the Dogman stared in horror and Bethod laughed and cheered him on. He could taste the blood now, and he shuddered and wiped his mouth.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There had been so many fewer people, and yet the stakes had been so much higher. The lives of the fighters, for one thing, and the ownership of land, of villages, of towns, the futures of whole clans. When he’d fought Tul Duru, no more than a hundred had watched, but perhaps the whole fate of the North had turned on that bloody half hour. If he’d lost then, if the Thunderhead had killed him, would things be the same? If Black Dow, or Harding Grim, or any of those others had put him in the mud, would Bethod have a golden chain now, and call himself a King? Would this Union be at war with the North? The thought made his head hurt. Even more.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You alright?” asked Bayaz.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Mmm,” Logen mumbled, but he was shivering, even in the heat. What were all these people here for? Only to be amused. Few could’ve found Logen’s battles very amusing, except Bethod, perhaps. Few others. “This isn’t like my fights,” he muttered to himself.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What’s that?” asked Bayaz.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Nothing.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Uh.” The old man beamed around at the crowd, scratching at his short grey beard. “Who do you think will win?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen really didn’t much care, but he reckoned that any distraction from his memories was welcome. He peered into the enclosures where the two fighters were getting ready, not far from where he was sitting. The handsome, proud young man they’d met at the gate was one of them. The other was heavy and powerful-looking, with a thick neck and a look almost bored.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know anything about this business.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“What, you? The Bloody-Nine? A champion who fought and won ten challenges? The most feared man in the North? No opinion? Surely single combat is the same the world over!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen winced and licked his lips. The Bloody-Nine. That was far in the past, but not far enough for his liking. His mouth still tasted like metal, like salt, like blood. Touching a man with a sword and cutting him open with one are hardly the same things, but he looked the two opponents over again. The proud young man rolled up his sleeves, touched his toes, swivelled his body this way and that, swung his arms round in quick windmills, watched by a stern old soldier in a spotless red uniform. A tall, worried-looking man handed the fighter two thin swords, one longer than the other, and he whisked them around before him in the air with impressive speed, blades flashing.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">His opponent stood there, leaning against the wooden side of his enclosure, stretching his bull neck from side to side without much hurry, glancing round with lazy eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Who’s who?” asked Logen.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“The pompous ass from the gate is Luthar. The one who’s half asleep is Gorst.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was plain who the crowd preferred. Luthar’s name could be heard often in the din, and whoops and claps greeted every movement of his thin swords. He looked quick, and deft, and clever, but there was something deadly in that big man’s waiting slouch, something dark about his heavy-lidded eyes. Logen would rather have fought Luthar, for all his speed. “I reckon Gorst.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gorst, really?” Bayaz’ eyes sparkled. “How about a little bet?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Logen heard a sharp suck of breath from Quai. “Never bet against a Magus,” whispered the apprentice.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It didn’t seem to make much difference to Logen. “What the hell have I got to bet with?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz shrugged. “Well, let’s just say for honour then?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“If you like.” Logen had never had too much of that, and the little he did have he didn’t care about losing.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bremer dan Gorst!” The scattered clapping was smothered by an avalanche of hisses and boos as the great ox shambled towards his mark, half-closed eyes on the ground, big, heavy steels dangling from his big, heavy hands. Between his short-cropped hair and the collar of his shirt, where his neck should have been, there was nothing but a thick fold of muscle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Ugly bastard,” Jezal murmured to himself, as he watched him go. “Damn idiot ugly bastard.” But his curses lacked conviction, even to his own ear. He had watched that man fight three bouts and demolish three good opponents. One of them had still to leave his sick bed a week later. Jezal had been training for the last few days specifically to counter Gorst’s bludgeoning style: Varuz and West swinging big broom handles at him while he dodged this way and that. More than once one of them had made contact, and Jezal was still smarting from the bruises.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Gorst?” offered the referee plaintively, doing his best to wheedle some applause from the audience, but they were having none of it. The boos only became louder, joined by jeers and heckling as Gorst took his mark.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You clumsy ox!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Get back to your farm and pull a plough!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bremer the brute!” and other such.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The people stretched back, and back, and back into obscurity. Everyone was there. Everyone in the world, it looked like. Every commoner in the city round the distant edges. Every gentleman, artisan and trader thronging the middle benches. Every noble man or woman in the Agriont towards the front, from fifth sons of high-born nobodies to the great magnates of the Open and Closed Councils. The Royal box was full: the Queen, the two Princes, Lord Hoff, the Princess Terez. The King even appeared to be awake for once, truly an honour, his goggling eyes staring around in amazement. Out there somewhere were Jezal’s father and his brothers, his friends and fellow officers, his entire acquaintance, more or less. Ardee too, he hoped, watching…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">All in all, it was quite an audience.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Jezal dan Luthar!” bellowed the referee. The meaningless bibble-babble of the crowd surged into a storm of cheering, a thunderous wave of support. The cries and shouts rang and echoed around the arena, making Jezal’s head throb.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Come on, Luthar!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Luthar!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Kill the bastard!” and other such.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Off you go, Jezal,” whispered Marshal Varuz in his ear, clapping him on the back and pushing him gently out towards the circle, “and good luck!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal walked in a daze, the noise of the crowd punching at his ears until it seemed his head would split. The training of the last few months flashed through his mind. The running, the swimming, the work with the heavy bar. The sparring, the beam, the endless forms. The punishment, the study, the sweating and the pain. Just so he could stand here. Seven touches. The first to four. It all came down to this.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He took his mark opposite Gorst, and stared into those heavy-lidded eyes. They looked back, cool and calm, seeming almost to stare past him as though he wasn’t there. That needled him and he pushed the thoughts out of his head and raised high his noble chin. He would not, </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">could</span></span><span class="calibre3"> not, let this oaf get the better of him. He would show all these people his blood, and his skill, and his mettle. He was Jezal dan Luthar. He would win. It was an incontestable fact. He knew it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Begin!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The first cut sent him reeling, shattering his confidence, his poise, and nearly his wrist. He had been watching Gorst fence, of course, if you could call it that, so he knew the man would come out swinging, but nothing could have prepared him for that first shattering contact. The crowd gasped with him as he staggered back. All his carefully laid plans, all of Varuz’ carefully worded advice, vanished into air. He winced with pain and shock, his arm still vibrating from the force of that mighty blow, his ears still ringing from the crashing noise of it, his mouth hanging open, his knees wobbling.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was hardly the most promising start, but the next chop followed hard after the first, flashing down with even greater power. Jezal leaped aside and slid away, trying to make room and give himself time. Time to work out some tactic, some trick to stem the pitiless tide of swinging metal. But Gorst was not about to give him time. He was already loosing another throaty growl, his long steel already begun on its next irresistible arc.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal dodged where he could, blocked where he couldn’t, his wrists already aching from the ceaseless punishment. To begin with he hoped that Gorst would tire. No one could throw those great lumps of metal around for long the way that he was doing. Soon the fierce pace would take its toll on the big man and he would slow, and droop, and the heavy steels would lose their venom. Then Jezal would fight back doggedly, run his opponent ragged, and win. The crowd would crack the Agriont with their cheers. A classic tale of victory against the odds.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Only Gorst did not tire. The man was a machine. After a few minutes there was still not the slightest sign of weariness in those heavy-lidded eyes. There was barely any emotion of any kind that Jezal could see, during the rare moments when he dared to take his eyes away from the flashing swords. The big long steel swung, swung, swung in its brutal circles, and the short steel was always there to turn away such feeble efforts as Jezal could make in between, never faltering or dropping even an inch. The power of the blows did not decrease, the growls tore from Gorst’s throat with as much vigour as ever. The crowd were given nothing to cheer at, and merely muttered angrily. It was Jezal who began to feel his legs slowing, to feel the sweat springing out of his forehead, to feel his grip on his steels slipping.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He saw it coming from a mile away, but there was nothing he could do about it. He had backed off until he ran out of circle. He had blocked and parried until he lost the feeling in his fingers. This time, when he raised his aching arm and there was the crash of metal on metal, one tired foot slipped and he tumbled squawking from the ring, floundering on his side, his short steel spinning from his twitching fingers. His face slapped against the ground and he took a gritty mouthful of sand. It was a painful and embarrassing fall, but he felt too tired and too battered to be all that disappointed. He was almost relieved that the punishment was over, if only for a moment.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“One to Gorst!” shouted the referee. A light dusting of applause was crushed beneath hoots of derision, but the big man seemed scarcely to notice, shuffling back to his mark with his head down and already preparing for the next touch.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal rolled slowly onto his hands and knees, flexing his aching hands and taking his time getting up. He needed a moment to breathe and make ready, to think up some strategy. Gorst waited for him: big, silent, still. Jezal brushed the sand from his shirt, mind racing. How to beat him? How? He stepped cautiously back to his mark, raised his steels.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Begin!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">This time Gorst came out even harder, slashing away as if he was scything wheat, making Jezal dance around the circle. One blow passed so close to his left side that he could feel the wind from it on his cheek. The next missed him by a margin no greater on his right. Then Gorst flung a sideways sweep aimed at his head and Jezal saw an opening. He ducked beneath it, sure the blade tore at the hairs on top of his scalp. He closed the distance as the heavy long steel swung away, almost catching the referee in the face on the back-swing, leaving Gorst’s right side all but undefended.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal lunged at the big bastard, sure he had finally got through, knowing he had made it one touch apiece. But Gorst caught the thrust on his short steel and forced it just wide, the guards of the two blades scraping then locking together. Jezal cut at him viciously with his short steel but somehow Gorst blocked that too, bringing up his other sword just in time, catching Jezal’s blade and holding it just short of his chest.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">For a moment their four steels were locked together, hilts grating, their faces just a few inches apart. Jezal was snarling like a dog, teeth bared, the muscles of his face a rigid mask. Gorst’s heavy features showed little sign of effort. He looked like a man having a piss: involved in a mundane and faintly distasteful task that must simply be done with as quickly as possible.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">For a moment their blades were locked together, Jezal pushing with every grain of strength, each hard-trained muscle flexing: legs straining against the ground, stomach straining to twist his arms, arms straining to push his hands, hands gripped around the hilts of his steels like grim death. Every muscle, every sinew, every tendon. He knew he had the better position, the big man was off balance, if only he could push him back a step… an inch…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">For that moment their steels were locked together, then Gorst dipped his shoulder, and grunted, and flung Jezal away as a child might fling away a boring toy.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He tumbled back, mouth and eyes wide open with surprise, feet kicking at the dirt, all his attention focused on staying upright. He heard Gorst growl again, and was shocked to see the heavy long steel already curving through the air towards him. He was in no position to dodge, and there was no time anyway. He raised his left arm on an instinct, but the thick, blunted blade tore his short steel away like a straw on the wind and crashed into his ribs, hammering the breath from his body in a wail of pain that echoed round and round the silent arena. His legs crumpled under him and he sprawled out on the turf, limbs flopping, sighing like a split bellows.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">This time there was not even the shadow of applause. The crowd roared their hatred, booing and hissing at Gorst for all they were worth as he trudged back to his enclosure.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Damn you, Gorst, you thug!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Get up Luthar! Up and at him!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Go home, you brute!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“You damn savage!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Their hisses turned to half-hearted cheers as Jezal picked himself up off the grass, his whole left side pulsing. He would have screamed with the pain if he had any breath left in him. For all his effort, for all his training, he was utterly outclassed and he knew it. The thought of doing it all again next year made him want to vomit. He did his best to appear undaunted as he struggled back to his enclosure, but he could not help sagging down heavily in his chair when he got there, dropping his notched steels on the flags and gasping for breath.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West bent over him and pulled up his shirt to check the damage. Jezal peered down gingerly, half expecting to see a great hole caved in his side, but there was only an ugly red welt across his ribs, some bruising already coming up around it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Anything broken?” asked Marshal Varuz, peering over West’s shoulder.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal fought back the tears as the Major probed his side. “I don’t think so, but damn it!” West threw his towel down in disgust. “You call this the beautiful sport? Is there no rule against these heavy steels?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Varuz shook his head grimly. “They all have to be the same length, but there’s no rule for the weight. I mean, why would anyone want heavy ones?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Now we know, don’t we!” snapped West. “Are you sure we shouldn’t stop this before that bastard takes his head off?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Varuz ignored him. “Now look here,” said the old Marshal, leaning down to talk in Jezal’s face. “It’s the best of seven touches! First to four! There’s still time!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Time for what? For Jezal to get cut in half, blunted steels or no? “He’s too strong!” Jezal gasped.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Too strong? No one’s too strong for you!” But even Varuz looked doubtful. “There’s still time! You can beat him!” The old Marshal tugged at his moustaches. “You can beat him!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But Jezal noticed he did not suggest how.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta was becoming worried he might choke, so convulsive was his laughter. He tried to think of something he would rather see than Jezal dan Luthar being smashed around a fencing circle, and failed. The young man winced as he just barely blocked a raking cut. He had not been handling his left side at all well since he took that blow in the ribs, and Glokta could almost feel his pain. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And my, my, how nice it is to feel someone else’s for a change.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> The crowd sulked, silent and brooding as Gorst harried their favourite around with his brutal slashes, while Glokta spluttered giggles through his clenched gums.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Luthar was quick and flashy, and he moved well once he saw the steels coming. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">A competent fighter. Good enough to win a Contest, no doubt, in a mediocre year. Quick feet, and quick hands, but his mind is not as sharp as it should be. As it needs to be. He is too predictable.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Gorst was an entirely different proposition. He seemed to be swinging, and swinging, without a thought in his head. But Glokta knew better. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">He has a whole new way of doing things. It was all jab, jab in my day. By next year’s Contest they’ll all be chopping away with these big, heavy steels.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta wondered idly if he could have beaten Gorst, at his best. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">It would have been a bout worth seeing anyway—a damn sight better than this mismatch.</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Gorst easily dealt with a couple of limp jabs, then Glokta winced and the crowd hissed as Luthar just barely parried another great butcher’s chop, the force of it nearly lifting him off his feet. He had no way to avoid the next swing, pressed against the edge of the circle as he was, and he was forced to jump back into the sand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Three to nothing!” shouted the referee.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Glokta shook with merriment as he watched Luthar chop at the ground in frustration, sending up a petulant spray of sand, his face a picture of pale self-pity. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Dear me, Captain Luthar, it will be four to nothing. A whitewash. An embarrassment. Perhaps this will teach that whining little shit some humility. Some men are better off for a good beating. Only look at me, eh?</span></span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Begin!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The fourth touch began precisely as the third had ended. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">With Luthar taking a hammering.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta could see it, the man was out of ideas. His left arm was moving slowly, painfully, his feet looked heavy. Another numbing blow crashed against his long steel, making him stumble back towards the edge of the circle, off-balance and gasping. Gorst needed only to press his attack a little further. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">And something tells me he is not the man to let up when he’s ahead.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta grabbed his cane, pushed himself to his feet. Anyone could see it was all over, and he had no wish to be caught in the crush as the disappointed crowds all tried to leave at once.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Gorst’s heavy long steel flashed down through the air. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">The final blow, surely.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Luthar’s only choice was to try and block it and be knocked clean out of the circle. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Or it might just split his fat head. We can hope for that.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Glokta smiled, half turned to leave.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But out of the corner of his eye, somehow, he saw the cut miss. Gorst blinked as his heavy long steel thudded into the turf, then grunted as Luthar caught him across the leg with a left-handed cut. It was the most emotion he had shown all day.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“One to Luthar!” shouted the referee after a brief pause, unable to entirely keep the amazement out of his voice.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“No,” murmured Glokta to himself, as the crowd around him erupted into riotous applause. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">No.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He had fought hundreds of touches in his youth, and watched thousands more, but he had never seen anything quite like that, never seen anyone move so quickly. Luthar was a good swordsman, he knew it. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">But no one is that good.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He frowned as he watched the two finalists come out from their second break and take their marks.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Begin!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Luthar was transformed. He harried Gorst with furious, lightning jabs, giving him no time to get started. It was the big man now who seemed stretched to the limit: blocking, dodging, trying to stay out of reach. It was as though they had sneaked the old Luthar away in the break and replaced him with a different man altogether: a stronger, faster, far more confident twin brother.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">So long denied something to cheer for, the crowd whooped and yelled as though they’d split their throats. Glokta did not share their enthusiasm. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Something is wrong here. Something is wrong.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> He glanced across the faces nearby, but no one else had sensed anything amiss. They only saw what they wanted to see: Luthar giving the ugly brute a spectacular and well-deserved thrashing. Glokta’s eyes scanned across the benches, not knowing what he was looking for.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz, so-called.</span></span><span class="calibre3"> Sitting near the front, leaning forward and staring at the two fighters with fixed concentration, his “apprentice” and the scarred Northman beside him. No one else noticed it, everyone was intent on the fighters before them, but Glokta did. He rubbed his eyes and looked again. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Something wrong.</span></span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Say one thing for the First of the Magi, say he’s a cheating bastard,” growled Logen.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Bayaz had a little smile at the corner of his mouth as he mopped the sweat from his forehead. “Who ever said he wasn’t?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Luthar was in trouble again. Bad trouble. Each time he blocked one of those heavy sweeps, his swords snapped back further, his grip seemed slacker. Each time he dodged, he ended up a little further back towards the edge of the yellow circle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Then, when the end seemed certain, out of the corner of his eye, Logen saw the air above Bayaz’ shoulders shimmer, as it had on the road south when the trees burned, and he felt that strange tugging at his guts.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Luthar seemed suddenly to find new vigour. He caught the next great blow on the grip of his short sword. A moment before, it might easily have sent the thing flying from his hand. Now he held it there for an instant, then flung it away with a cry, pushing his opponent off balance and jumping forward, suddenly on the attack.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“If you were caught cheating in a Northern duel,” growled Logen, shaking his head, “they’d cut the bloody cross into your stomach and pull your guts out.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Lucky for me,” murmured Bayaz through gritted teeth, without taking his eyes away from the fighters, “that we are in the North no longer.” Sweat was already beading his bald scalp again, running down his face in fat drops. His fists were clenched tight and trembling with effort.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Luthar struck furiously, again and again, his swords a flashing blur. Gorst grunted and growled as he turned the blows away, but Luthar was too quick for him now, and too strong. He drove him mercilessly across the circle like a crazy dog might drive a cow.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Fucking cheating,” growled Logen again, as Luthar’s blade flashed and left a bright red line across Gorst’s cheek. A few drops of blood spattered across into the crowd on Logen’s left, and they exploded into riotous cheering. That, just for a moment, was a shadow of his own duels. The referee’s cry of three apiece could hardly be heard at all. Gorst frowned slightly and touched one hand to his face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Above the din, Logen could just hear Quai’s whisper. “Never bet against a Magus…”</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal knew that he was good, but he had never dreamed he could be </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">this</span></span><span class="calibre3"> good. He was sharp as a cat, nimble as a fly, strong as a bear. His ribs no longer hurt, his wrists no longer hurt, all trace of tiredness had left him, all trace of doubt. He was fearless, peerless, unstoppable. The applause thundered around him and yet he could hear every word of it, see every detail of every face in the crowd. His heart was pumping tingling fire instead of blood, his lungs were sucking in the very clouds.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He did not bother even to sit in the break, so great was his eagerness to get back into the circle. The chair was an insult to him. He was not listening to what Varuz and West were saying. They were of no importance. Little people, far below. They stared at him: flushed, amazed, as well they might be.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">He was the greatest swordsman ever.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">That cripple Glokta could not have known how right he was: Jezal had only to try, it seemed, and he could have anything he wanted. He chuckled as he danced back to the mark. He laughed as he heard the crowds cheer. He smiled at Gorst as he stepped back into the circle. All was precisely as it should be. Those eyes were still heavy-lidded, lazy above the little red cut that Jezal had given him, but there was something else there now as well: a trace of shock, of wariness, of respect. As well there might be.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was nothing that Jezal could not do. He was invincible. He was unstoppable. He was…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Begin!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">…completely lost. The pain lanced through his side and made him gasp. Suddenly he was afraid, and tired, and weak again. Gorst growled and unleashed his savage cuts, jarring the steels in Jezal’s hands, making him jump like a frightened rabbit. The mastery was gone, the anticipation, the nerve, and Gorst’s onslaught was more brutal than ever. He felt a terrible lurch of despair as his long steel was torn from his buzzing fingers, flew through the air and clattered into the barrier. Jezal was bludgeoned to his knees. The crowd gasped. It was all over…</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">…It was not over. The blow was arcing down towards him. The final blow. It seemed to drift. Slow, slow, as though through honey. Jezal smiled. It was a simple matter for him to push it away with his short steel. The strength flowed again. He sprang upwards, shoved Gorst away with his empty hand, flicked another swing aside, and then another, his one sword doing the work of two with time to spare. The arena was breathless silent but for the rapid clashing of the steels. Right and left, right and left went the short blade, flashing faster than his eye could follow, faster than his mind could think, seeming almost to be dragging him along behind it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">There was a squeal of metal on metal as it tore Gorst’s notched long steel from his hand, then another as it flickered across and did the same with his short. For a moment, all was still. The big man, disarmed and with his heels on the very edge of the circle, looked up at Jezal. The crowd was silent.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Then Jezal slowly lifted his short steel, all of a sudden seeming to weigh a ton, and poked Gorst gently in the ribs with it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Huh,” said the big man quietly, raising his eyebrows.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Then the crowd exploded into deafening applause. The noise went on and on, rising and rising, washing over Jezal in waves. Now that it was finished he felt drained beyond description. He closed his eyes, swaying, his sword dropped from his nerveless fingers and he sank to his knees. He was beyond exhaustion. It was as though he had used a whole week’s energy in a few moments. Even kneeling was an effort he was not sure he could sustain for long, and if he fell he was not sure he could ever get up again.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But then he felt strong hands taking him under the arms, and felt himself being lifted. The noise of the crowd grew even louder as he was hoisted into the air. He opened his eyes—bleary, blurry colour flashed in front of him as he was turned around. His head rang with the sound. He was up on someone’s shoulders. A shaved head. Gorst. The big man had lifted him up, as a father might lift his child, displaying him to the crowd, smiling up at him with a big, ugly grin. Jezal smiled back despite himself. It was a strange moment, all in all.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Luthar wins!” cried the referee pointlessly, barely audible. “Luthar wins!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The cheering had resolved itself into a steady chant of “Luthar! Luthar! Luthar!” The arena shook with it. Jezal’s head swam with it. It was like being drunk. Drunk on victory. Drunk on yourself.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Gorst lowered him back to the circle as the cheering of the crowd began to fade. “You beat me,” he said, smiling wide. His voice was strangely high and soft, almost like a woman’s. “Fair and square. I’d like to be the first to congratulate you.” And he nodded his big head and smiled again, rubbing at the cut under his eye without the slightest bitterness. “You deserve it,” he said, holding out his hand.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Thank you.” Jezal flashed a sour smile and gave the man’s big paw as cursory a squeeze as possible, then he turned away towards his enclosure. Of course he fucking deserved it, and he was damned if he would let that bastard bask in his reflected glory a moment longer.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Bravely done, my boy, bravely done!” frothed Marshal Varuz, slapping him on the shoulder as he stumbled back to his chair on wobbly legs. “I knew you could do it!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">West grinned as he handed him the towel. “They’ll be talking about this for years.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Other well-wishers crowded in, offering their congratulations, leaning over the barrier. A whirl of smiling faces, and in amongst them the face of Jezal’s father, shining with pride. “I knew that you could do it, Jezal! I never doubted! Not for a minute! You’ve brought honour to our family!” Jezal noticed that his elder brother didn’t look all that pleased about it, though. He had the usual stodgy, envious expression on his face, even at Jezal’s moment of victory. The stodgy, envious bastard. Could he not be happy for his brother, if only for one day?</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“May I too congratulate the winner?” came a voice from over his shoulder. It was that old idiot, the one from the gate, the one whom Sulfur had called his master. The one who had used the name Bayaz. He had sweat on his bald skull, a lot of it. His face was pale, his eyes sunken. Almost as if he had just done seven touches with Gorst. “Well done indeed, my young friend, an almost… magical performance.”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Thank you,” muttered Jezal. He was not at all sure who this old man was, or what he was after, but he did not trust him in the least. “I am sorry though, I must—”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Of course. We will talk later.” He said it with a disturbing finality, as if it were a thing already arranged. Then he turned away and vanished smoothly into the crowds. Jezal’s father stared after him, ashen-faced now, as though he had seen a ghost.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Do you know him, father?”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Jezal!” Varuz grabbed his arm excitedly. “Come! The King wishes to congratulate you!” He dragged Jezal from his family and towards the circle. A scattering of applause rose up again as they walked together across the dry grass, the scene of Jezal’s victory. The Lord Marshal slung a fatherly arm around his shoulder, and smiled up at the crowds as though the applause was all for him. Everyone wanted a piece of his glory, it seemed, but Jezal was able to shake the old man off as he mounted the steps of the royal box.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Prince Raynault, youngest son of the King, was first in line, humbly dressed, honest and thoughtful-seeming, scarcely looking like royalty at all. “Well done!” he shouted over the roar of the crowd, sounding truly delighted for Jezal’s victory. “Well done indeed!” His older brother was more exuberant.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Incredible!” shouted Crown Prince Ladisla, the sunlight glinting off the golden buttons on his white jacket. “Capital! Amazing! Spectacular! I never saw such a thing!” Jezal grinned and bowed humbly as he went past, hunching his shoulders as the Crown Prince slapped him somewhat too hard on the back. “I always knew you’d do it! You were always my man!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The Princess Terez, only daughter of the Grand Duke Orso of Talins, watched Jezal pass with a tiny, disdainful smile, tapping two languid fingers against her palm in a quarter-hearted imitation of clapping. Her chin was raised painfully high, as though just to be looked at by her was an honour he could never fully appreciate, and certainly did not deserve.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">And so he came at last to the high seat of Guslav the fifth, High King of the Union. His head was slumped sideways, squashed down under the sparkling crown. His pasty pale fingers twitched on his crimson silk mantle like white slugs. His eyes were closed, chest rising and falling gently, accompanied by gentle splutterings as spittle issued from his slack lips and ran down his chin, joining the sweat on his bulging jowls and helping it to turn his high collar dark with wet.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Truly, Jezal was in the presence of greatness.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Your Majesty,” murmured Lord Hoff. The head of state did not respond. His wife the Queen looked on, painfully erect, a fixed, emotionless smile plastered across her well-powdered face.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal hardly knew where to look, and settled on his dusty shoes. The Lord Chamberlain coughed loudly. A muscle twitched beneath the sweaty fat on the side of the King’s face, but he did not wake. Hoff winced, and, glancing around to make sure no one was watching too closely, jabbed the royal ribs with his finger.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">The King jumped, eyelids suddenly flicking wide open, heavy jowls wobbling, staring at Jezal with wild, bloodshot, red-rimmed eyes.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Your Majesty, this is Captain…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“Raynault!” exclaimed the King, “my son!”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">Jezal swallowed nervously, doing his best to maintain a rigid smile of his own. The senile old fool had mistaken him for his younger son. Worse yet, the Prince himself was standing not four paces away. The Queen’s wooden grin twitched slightly. Princess Terez’ perfect lips twisted with scorn. The Lord Chamberlain gave an awkward cough. “Er, no, your Majesty, this is…”</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">But it was too late. Without any warning, the monarch struggled to his feet and folded Jezal in an enthusiastic embrace, his heavy crown slipping over to one side of his head and one of its jewel-encrusted prongs nearly poking Jezal in the eye. Lord Hoff’s jaw opened silently. The two Princes goggled. Jezal could only manage a helpless gurgle.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">“My son!” blubbered the King, his voice choked with emotion. “Raynault, I’m so glad you’re back! When I am gone, Ladisla will need your help. He is so weak, and the crown is such a heavy weight! You were always the better suited for it! Such a heavy weight!” he sobbed into Jezal’s shoulder.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was like a hideous nightmare. Ladisla and the real Raynault gawped at each other, then back at their father, both looking sick. Terez was sneering down her nose at her prospective father-in-law with undisguised contempt. From bad to much, much worse. What the hell did one do in such a situation? Could there possibly be any etiquette devised for this? Jezal patted his King awkwardly on his fat back. What else could he do? Shove the senile old idiot over on his arse, with half of his subjects looking on? He was almost tempted to do it.</span></p><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre3">It was a small mercy that the crowds took the King’s embrace for a ringing endorsement of Jezal’s fencing abilities, and drowned out his words with a fresh wave of cheering. No one beyond the royal box heard what he said. They all missed the full significance of what was, without doubt, the most embarrassing moment of Jezal’s life.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_39"></div></div></body>
